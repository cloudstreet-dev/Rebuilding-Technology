# Appendix A2: Master Tools List

This appendix consolidates all tools referenced throughout this book, organized by the bootstrap sequence—what tools you need to make other tools.

---

## The Bootstrap Problem

You need tools to make tools. But where do the first tools come from?

**Answer**: Salvage, stone tools, and wooden tools bootstrap metalworking. Metalworking makes better tools. Better tools enable precision. Precision enables industry.

This appendix shows the dependency chain so you understand what must come before what.

---

## Tool Tier Classification

**Tier 0 - Primitive**: Can be made with bare hands and found materials (stone, wood, bone).

**Tier 1 - Basic**: Can be made with Tier 0 tools and fire. Simple forge work.

**Tier 2 - Intermediate**: Requires Tier 1 tools. Basic machine tools.

**Tier 3 - Advanced**: Requires Tier 2 machine tools. Precision manufacturing.

**Tier 4 - Industrial**: Requires Tier 3 capability. Modern manufacturing equivalent.

## Tools for Making Tools

This section shows which tools are needed to make other tools.

### Making a Lathe

**Required to make a lathe**:
- Forge (for parts)
- Files (for fitting)
- Drill (for holes)
- Taps (for threads)
- Saw (cutting stock)
- Measuring tools (square, rule)
- Existing lathe helps immensely (chicken-and-egg problem)

**Without an existing lathe**:
- Cast the bed (flat ways possible with casting)
- Scrape ways flat (requires surface plate + scrapers)
- Forge the spindle, grind in situ
- Make bearings from babbitt or bronze
- Make lead screw by hand-cutting threads (extremely difficult)

**The Lathe Paradox**: "It takes a lathe to make a lathe" is nearly true. Solutions:
1. Salvage a lathe
2. Use a wood lathe to make parts for a metal lathe
3. Accept very crude first lathe, iterate to precision

### Making Files

**Why files are the problem**: Files require harder steel than the file itself. You need files to make files.

**Possible approaches**:
1. **Salvage only** - Most practical
2. **Diamond or carbide** - For cutting hardened steel (salvage only)
3. **Grinding** - Grind teeth with harder wheel (slow, imprecise)
4. **Electro-discharge** - Advanced technology

**Reality**: Treat files as non-renewable salvage for at least 20 years.

### Making Drill Bits

**Twist drills** (standard drills):
- Grind from tool steel rod
- Requires precise flute grinding
- Practical with grinder

**Flat drills** (spade type):
- Forge and grind flat point
- Simpler but less precise
- Adequate for many applications

**Achievable post-collapse**: Start with flat drills. Progress to twist drills as grinding capability improves.

### Making Taps and Dies

**Taps** (cut internal threads):
- Turn thread on lathe from tool steel
- Harden
- Grind flutes
- First generation: Slow, careful single-point threading
- Later: Die-cut threads on tap blanks

**Dies** (cut external threads):
- Drill and tap die blank
- Add clearance cuts (flutes)
- Harden
- First generation: Very difficult without existing dies
- Later: Use existing dies to thread die blanks

**Bootstrap**: The first tap/die set is extremely difficult. Salvage is strongly preferred.

- Broken cast iron (can sometimes weld)
- Damaged precision instruments

**Prevention is better than repair**. Use tools correctly, maintain them, store properly.

---

## Tool Storage

### Principles

1. **Dry** - Moisture causes rust
2. **Clean** - Dirt causes wear
3. **Organized** - Finding tools quickly
4. **Protected** - Edges protected from damage
5. **Accessible** - Frequently used tools at hand

### Storage Methods

| Tool Type | Storage Method |
|-----------|----------------|
| Hand tools | Wall racks, tool boxes, shadow boards |
| Files | Racks (teeth not touching each other) |
| Cutting tools | Individual holders, oiled |
| Measuring tools | Cases, padded drawers |
| Machine tool accessories | Racks, organized by size |
| Precision tools | Climate-controlled if possible |

### Rust Prevention

- Oil all steel surfaces before storage
- Use VCI (vapor corrosion inhibitor) paper if available
- Desiccants in closed storage
- Climate control (reduce humidity)
- Regular inspection and re-oiling

## Notes on Specific Critical Tools

### The Anvil

- 100 lb minimum for general work
- Railroad track is usable (set on end)
- Large flat rock works in emergency
- Never weld on the face

### Files

- Cannot be practically made without existing files
- Teeth wear and cannot be resharpened
- Card frequently to extend life
- Never use without handle (safety)
- Store to prevent teeth damage
- Different cuts for different work

### The Lathe

- "Mother of machine tools"
- Makes round parts, threads, bores
- Even crude lathe is transformative
- Bed accuracy determines part accuracy
- Lead screw enables threading

### Precision Measuring Tools

- Foundation of interchangeable parts
- Salvage all precision instruments
- Store carefully (temperature, humidity)
- Calibrate regularly against standards
- Cannot be made without precision equipment

**Remember**: Tools are force multipliers. The right tool makes work possible. The wrong tool makes work dangerous. No tool makes work impossible.

Your tool inventory determines what you can build. Expand it deliberately, maintain it carefully, and never stop thinking about what tools you'll need next.
