# Introduction: Rebuilding Technology After Collapse

## Purpose of This Guide

You are reading this because technological civilization has collapsed. The global supply chains that once delivered silicon chips, rare earth elements, and precision machinery have failed. The internet is gone. The power grid is down. The factories are silent.

But knowledge survives. This guide exists to help you rebuild—not to the level of 2025 technology immediately, but through a practical, achievable path from salvage and basic materials to functioning computers, communications networks, and eventually artificial intelligence.

## Who This Guide Is For

This book assumes you are part of a surviving community with:
- Basic literacy and mathematical understanding
- Access to ruins of the old world (for salvage)
- Ability to organize labor and resources
- Time horizon of decades, not months

You don't need to be an engineer or scientist, but you'll need patience, experimentation, and the ability to teach others.

## How to Use This Guide

**Don't read this linearly.** Technology rebuilding is not a straight path. You'll need to:

1. **Assess your situation first** - What ruins are nearby? What natural resources? How many people can you mobilize?
2. **Start with immediate needs** - Power generation, basic tools, preserved knowledge
3. **Build foundations in parallel** - Metallurgy, chemistry, and manufacturing capability
4. **Progress in stages** - Each chapter builds on previous capabilities

**Key principle: Salvage first, manufacture second.** The ruins of 2025 contain billions of tons of refined metals, glass, plastics, and even functioning components. Mining and refining from ore should be your last resort.

## Technology Tiers

This guide organizes rebuilding into tiers:

**Tier 0: Survival Technology (Immediate)**
- Salvaging materials
- Basic metallurgy and smithing
- Simple chemistry
- Mechanical power (water, wind)

**Tier 1: Foundation Technology (Years 1-10)**
- Electricity generation and storage
- Basic electronics (diodes, resistors, capacitors)
- Telegraph and radio communication
- Precision metalworking
- Glass and chemical production

**Tier 2: Computing Technology (Years 10-30)**
- Vacuum tubes and transistors
- Simple computers and logic circuits
- Magnetic and solid-state storage
- Telephone networks
- Photography and optics

**Tier 3: Modern Computing (Years 30-50)**
- Integrated circuits (basic)
- Microprocessors
- Computer networks
- Digital communications
- CRT and LCD displays

**Tier 4: Advanced Technology (Years 50-100)**
- Modern microprocessors
- Cellular networks
- Internet protocols
- Artificial intelligence
- Semiconductor manufacturing at scale

## Critical Success Factors

**Preserve Knowledge**: Protect this guide and any other technical documentation. Create copies. Teach literacy.

**Organize Systematically**: Technology requires specialization. You'll need metallurgists, chemists, electricians, machinists, programmers—each training the next generation.

**Expect Setbacks**: Many processes will fail repeatedly. Build in redundancy and document failures.

**Think Generationally**: You probably won't see AI rebuilt in your lifetime. That's okay. You're laying foundations.

## What Makes This Different From History

When humans first developed technology, we did it through millennia of trial and error. You have advantages:

1. **Knowledge**: You know what's possible and roughly how it works
2. **Salvage**: Refined materials and sometimes working components
3. **Examples**: Ruins of the old world show what you're aiming for
4. **Mathematics**: Preserved mathematical and scientific knowledge

But you also face challenges:
- Smaller population and knowledge base
- Harder-to-access resources (easy deposits already mined)
- Potential loss of specialized knowledge
- No global trade network

## A Note on Safety

Many processes in this guide are dangerous:
- High voltage electricity can kill instantly
- Chemical processes can cause fires, explosions, and poisoning
- Molten metals cause severe burns
- Radiation from some salvaged materials is deadly

Each chapter includes safety warnings. **Take them seriously.** Rebuilding technology is worthless if you kill your craftspeople.

## The Path Forward

This will be hard. There will be generations where progress seems impossible. But humans built this civilization once from nothing. With knowledge as your guide, you can build it again.

Start with Chapter 1: Salvaging the Old World. It will teach you what to look for in the ruins and how to safely recover the materials you'll need for everything that follows.

Good luck. Civilization is counting on you.
