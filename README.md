# Rebuilding Technology: A Comprehensive Guide for Post-Apocalyptic Recovery

## About This Guide

This guide was compiled in 2025 as a comprehensive technical manual for rebuilding modern technology from a post-apocalyptic scenario. It assumes technological civilization has collapsed, supply chains are down, and survivors must rebuild from salvaged materials and basic resources.

The guide is designed to be practical and achievable, progressing through realistic stages from immediate survival technology to advanced computing and artificial intelligence over a span of **150-300+ years**. Yes, that long. This is a multi-generational project.

## How to Use This Guide

**DO NOT read this linearly from start to finish.** Technology rebuilding is not a straight path. Instead:

1. **Read Chapter -1 FIRST**: Immediate Survival. You cannot build technology if everyone is dead.
2. **Assess your situation**: What resources do you have? What salvage is available? How many people can you mobilize?
3. **Establish foundations**: Water, food, shelter, security, knowledge preservation (Chapters -1, 0.5, 0.7)
4. **Build in parallel**: Work on multiple technologies simultaneously as resources allow
5. **Follow dependencies**: Some technologies require others (you need electricity before electronics)
6. **Accept the timeline**: Semiconductors take centuries. Tube computers work fine. Don't rush.
7. **Document everything**: Add your own notes, discoveries, and modifications. **Copy this guide immediately** (Chapter 4.5).

Each chapter is written to be as self-contained as possible, with cross-references where dependencies exist.

- Building systems from many simple IC chips
- Think: 1970s minicomputer era

## Critical Success Factors

1. **Survive First, Technology Second**: Read Chapter -1 before anything else. You cannot rebuild electronics if everyone is dead from dysentery. Water, food, sanitation, and shelter come before metallurgy.

2. **Preserve Knowledge**: Protect this guide and all technical documentation. **Copy this guide immediately** using the techniques in Chapter 4.5 (Paper and Printing). Books decay. Store copies in multiple locations. Digital and physical.

3. **Organize Systematically**: Technology requires specialization. But specialization requires food surplus (Chapter 0.5). You cannot have blacksmiths if everyone must farm. Agriculture enables everything else.

4. **Salvage First, Manufacture Second**: The ruins contain refined materials and functional components. Never mine what you can salvage. The energy cost has already been paid.

5. **Document Failures**: Failed attempts teach as much as successes. Record what doesn't work and why.

6. **Think Generationally**: You probably won't see AI or modern computing rebuilt in your lifetime. You're laying foundations for your children's children. That's okay. This is a multi-generational project.

7. **Build Communities**: No one person can rebuild technology. This requires cooperation, coordination, and knowledge sharing across communities and regions.

8. **Copy This Guide**: This cannot be stressed enough. The first major technological project should be establishing a print shop (Chapter 4.5) and creating multiple copies of this guide. Distribute them widely. Books decay. Fire destroys. Redundancy saves civilization.

## Safety Warning

Many processes in this guide are dangerous:
- High voltage electricity can kill instantly
- Chemical processes can cause fires, explosions, and poisoning
- Molten metals cause severe burns
- Radiation from some salvaged materials is deadly
- Vacuum tube CRTs contain high voltage and can implode

**Each chapter includes specific safety warnings. Take them seriously.** Rebuilding technology is worthless if you kill your craftspeople. Patience and care will serve you better than speed.

## Final Thoughts

This guide represents the collective knowledge of thousands of engineers, scientists, and craftspeople accumulated over centuries. The technologies described here—from simple metallurgy to artificial intelligence—are humanity's greatest achievements.

You have a profound responsibility: to preserve this knowledge, to build upon it, and to pass it forward. The collapse was a setback, but not an end. With this knowledge, with determination, and with cooperation, technological civilization can be rebuilt.

It will be hard. Progress will be slow. There will be setbacks. But humans built this civilization once from nothing but curiosity and persistence. With knowledge as your guide, you can build it again—and perhaps build it better.

The path forward is clear. Start with salvage. Build your foundations. Progress in stages. Document everything. Teach others. Work together.

Civilization is counting on you.

Good luck.
