# Chapter 1: Salvaging the Old World

## Why Salvage Matters

The collapsed civilization of 2025 left behind an incredible treasure: billions of tons of refined materials. Mining copper ore and smelting it takes enormous energy and infrastructure. A single abandoned car contains 20-30 kg of steel, 10-15 kg of iron, 10-20 kg of aluminum, 1-2 kg of copper, and smaller amounts of zinc, lead, and precious metals.

**Core principle**: Never mine what you can salvage. The energy cost of extraction and refinement has already been paid.

## Prerequisites: Medical Response Capability Required

⚠️ **DO NOT BEGIN SALVAGE OPERATIONS UNTIL YOUR COMMUNITY HAS ESTABLISHED MEDICAL RESPONSE CAPABILITY**

Salvage work is dangerous. The injury risk is significantly higher than typical survival activities. Common salvage injuries include:
- Broken bones from floor collapses and falling debris
- Deep cuts from sharp metal edges, broken glass, and sheet metal
- Crush injuries from collapsing structures and heavy equipment
- Burns from electrical shorts and chemical exposure
- Puncture wounds from nails, rebar, and sharp objects

**Without medical treatment capability, these injuries become life-threatening.**

**Minimum medical readiness before starting salvage**:
- At least one person trained in first aid and wound treatment (see Chapter -1)
- Supplies for wound cleaning, bandaging, and basic treatment
- Stretcher or method to transport injured person
- Designated safe location for medical treatment
- Communication method to call for help (whistles, radios, runners)

**If your community cannot treat a broken leg, deep cut, or severe burn, delay salvage operations until medical infrastructure is established.** Focus on Chapter -1 (Immediate Survival) and Chapter 0.5 (Agriculture) first.

## Time Decay: The Salvage Window Is Closing

**Critical reality: Materials degrade. The best salvage opportunities are in the first 5-10 years post-collapse.**

Salvageable materials decay at different rates. Understanding these timelines helps prioritize what to salvage first.

### Rapid Degradation (1-5 Years)

**Rubber (tires, hoses, gaskets, belts):**
- UV exposure causes cracking within 1-3 years
- Ozone degradation (even indoors) continues
- Timeline:
  - Years 0-2: Excellent condition
  - Years 2-5: Usable but cracking, reduced elasticity
  - Years 5-10: Brittle, may crumble when stressed
  - Years 10+: Most rubber severely degraded, unusable
- **Action: Salvage rubber in Years 0-5. Prioritize tires, gaskets, and seals.**

**Fuel (gasoline, diesel, oils):**
- Gasoline degrades rapidly: 1-2 years before it gums up (oxidation, evaporation of volatile components)
- Diesel lasts longer: 5-10 years with stabilizers, 2-3 years without
- Propane/natural gas: Decades if containers intact (non-reactive)
- Motor oil, hydraulic fluid: Years to decades depending on contamination and storage
- **Timeline: Gasoline unusable after Year 2-3, diesel marginal after Year 5-10**
- **Action: Salvage fuel in Years 0-2. Test before use. Diesel lasts longer than gasoline.** (See section on Fuel Salvage below)

**Food and sealed consumables:**
- Canned food: 2-5 years typically, some may last 10+ if undamaged
- Medications: Most lose potency after 5-10 years
- Batteries (non-rechargeable): Alkaline batteries self-discharge, often dead within 5-10 years

### Medium Degradation (5-20 Years)

**Wiring insulation:**
- Plastic/rubber insulation becomes brittle in exposed conditions within 10-15 years
- UV, temperature cycling, and ozone cause cracking
- Copper wire itself remains good, but insulation fails
- Timeline:
  - Years 0-10: Insulation intact, wires safe to handle
  - Years 10-20: Insulation brittle, cracking, exposes bare wire
  - Years 20+: Insulation mostly gone, wires exposed
- **Action: Salvage insulated wire in Years 0-15. Prioritize higher-gauge (thicker) wire with better insulation.**

**Electronics (circuit boards, components):**
- Corrosion of solder joints and traces: Humidity accelerates (years to decades)
- Capacitor electrolyte dries out: 10-20 years typical
- Integrated circuits: Can survive decades if kept dry, but connections corrode
- Timeline:
  - Years 0-10: Most electronics salvageable, many still functional
  - Years 10-20: Increasing corrosion, capacitor failures, but components still extractable
  - Years 20+: Severe corrosion, many boards unusable, discrete components still valuable
- **Action: Salvage electronics in Years 0-15. Test early, store in dry conditions.**

**Solar panels:**
- Encapsulation degrades: Moisture infiltration causes cell corrosion
- Electrical connections oxidize
- Timeline:
  - Years 0-20: May function at 70-90% capacity
  - Years 20-50: Degraded but potentially usable (50-70% capacity)
  - Years 50+: Severe degradation, most panels dead
- **Action: Salvage and test solar panels in Years 0-20. Those still functioning are high priority.**

### Slow Degradation (20-100+ Years)

**Structural metals (iron, steel, aluminum):**
- Rust/corrosion: Depends heavily on environment (humidity, salt exposure)
- Timeline:
  - Years 0-20: Surface rust on steel, aluminum relatively intact
  - Years 20-50: Significant rust on exposed steel, structural weakening
  - Years 50-100: Severe corrosion, but usable metal still recoverable
  - Years 100+: Buildings collapsing, but metal still exists (can be re-smelted)
- **Action: Structural metals have long salvage window. Prioritize exposed materials first (outdoor equipment), then indoor materials.**

**Copper and noble metals (copper, brass, bronze, gold, silver):**
- Oxidation (copper turns green) but remains conductive and usable
- Gold and silver essentially don't corrode
- Timeline: Decades to centuries. Copper from Roman ruins is still usable after 2000 years.
- **Action: Copper has longest salvage window. Lower priority in early years.**

**Glass and ceramics:**
- Essentially permanent if not broken
- Timeline: Centuries to millennia
- **Action: Fragile but non-degrading. Salvage carefully when encountered, but not urgent.**

### Structural Collapse Timeline

**Buildings themselves degrade:**
- Wood-frame buildings:
  - Years 5-10: Roof leaks, water infiltration, mold
  - Years 10-20: Structural weakening, floor collapse risks
  - Years 20-50: Severe degradation, collapse likely
- Concrete buildings:
  - Years 10-30: Rebar corrosion, concrete spalling
  - Years 30-100: Progressive deterioration, but slower than wood
- Steel-frame buildings:
  - Years 20-50: Rust weakening, but slower collapse than wood-frame

**Salvage priority: Enter buildings in Years 0-10 while structurally safer. After Year 20, many buildings become too dangerous to enter.**

### Strategic Implications

**Years 0-5: Critical window**
- Salvage: Rubber, fuel, food, medications
- Rationale: These degrade fastest

**Years 5-10: Important window**
- Salvage: Electronics, solar panels, insulated wire, batteries
- Rationale: Functional components before corrosion/degradation

**Years 10-20: Extended window**
- Salvage: Motors, tools, precision instruments, structural metals
- Rationale: Still accessible and usable, but buildings becoming dangerous

**Years 20+: Late salvage**
- Salvage: Bulk metals (copper, steel, aluminum), glass, ceramics
- Rationale: These last longest. Focus on outdoor/accessible materials.

**The best salvage is early salvage.** Delay costs you materials.

## Safety First: Hazards in the Ruins

Before you begin salvaging, understand the dangers:

### Structural Hazards
- **Collapsed buildings**: Can collapse further. Never enter alone. Use support beams.
- **Unstable floors**: Rot and corrosion weaken structures. Test every step.
- **Falling debris**: Wear hard hats. Be aware of overhead hazards.

### Chemical Hazards

**Asbestos** (Common in pre-2000 buildings):
- **Locations**: Insulation (pipes, walls, attics), floor tiles, roofing shingles, ceiling tiles, brake pads, some textured paints
- **Danger**: Microscopic fibers cause lung cancer, mesothelioma (decades later - symptoms appear 20-40 years after exposure)
- **Identification**: Grayish, fibrous material; or suspect any insulation/tiles in pre-1980 buildings
- **Safe handling protocol**:
  1. **Avoid disturbance if possible**: If asbestos material is intact and not necessary, leave it alone
  2. **Wet it thoroughly**: Spray with water + detergent before and during any disturbance (prevents fiber release)
  3. **Respirator required**: N95 minimum (filters particles), P100 preferred (filters 99.97% of airborne particles)
  4. **Disposable clothing**: Or clothing that can be washed separately
  5. **Keep wet throughout removal**: Continuously mist while working
  6. **Double-bag in sealed plastic**: Thick plastic bags, taped shut, labeled "ASBESTOS - DO NOT OPEN"
  7. **Decontaminate**: Wash thoroughly, dispose of or wash contaminated clothing separately
  8. **Wet-wipe tools**: Remove fibers before storing
- **Best practice**: Avoidance is better than removal unless the material is absolutely necessary. Many asbestos-containing materials can be left in place safely if undisturbed.

**Lead paint** (buildings before ~1978):
- **Danger**: Lead poisoning (neurological damage, especially in children)
- **Handling**: Wear gloves when touching. Do not sand or burn (creates toxic dust/fumes).
- **Removal**: Wet scraping or chemical strippers (outdoors or well-ventilated)

**Refrigerants** (refrigerators, air conditioners, freezers):
- CFCs, HCFCs, HFCs: Toxic when heated, ozone-depleting
- **Handling**: Do not puncture lines. Vent in open air if releasing. Do not expose to flame.

**Batteries**:
- Lead-acid: Sulfuric acid (corrosive), lead (toxic). Wear gloves, eye protection.
- Lithium: Fire risk if damaged/shorted. Flammable electrolyte.
- Alkaline: Potassium hydroxide (caustic). Leaked batteries can burn skin.
- **Handling**: Insulate terminals (tape), avoid shorts, wear gloves if leaked.

**Unknown chemicals** (industrial sites, laboratories):
- **Rule**: If you can't identify it, leave it alone.
- Unlabeled containers may contain: Acids (sulfuric, hydrochloric, nitric), bases (sodium hydroxide), solvents (acetone, benzene), oxidizers, poisons, carcinogens
- **If you must investigate**: Approach cautiously, check for labels/MSDS sheets, note color/consistency/smell (from distance), mark location, ask if anyone recognizes it.
- **Do not**: Open unknown containers, mix chemicals, taste or closely smell unknowns.

### Electrical Hazards

**Capacitors** (electronics, power supplies, motor start capacitors):
- **Danger**: Large capacitors can hold lethal charges (hundreds to thousands of volts) for years after power is removed
- **Locations**: Power supplies, CRT televisions/monitors (very high voltage), motor start capacitors (air conditioners, fans), camera flashes
- **Identification**: Cylindrical or rectangular components, often labeled with voltage and capacitance
- **Safe discharge procedure**:
  1. **Assume charged**: Even if device has been off for years
  2. **Insulated gloves**: Rubber or heavy leather (electrical insulation)
  3. **Discharge resistor method** (CORRECT):
     - Use high-wattage resistor: 1kΩ to 10kΩ, rated for 10W or higher
     - Connect resistor across capacitor terminals using insulated clip leads
     - Wait 30-60 seconds (allows slow discharge, dissipates energy as heat in resistor)
     - **Why resistor**: Prevents arcing and component damage from direct short
  4. **Verify discharge**: Use multimeter to measure voltage across terminals (should be zero or near-zero)
  5. **Wait additional time**: Even after reading zero, wait 10-20 seconds (some capacitors can recover slight charge)
  6. **Final short**: After resistor discharge and voltage check, short terminals directly with insulated screwdriver (as final safety check)
- **DO NOT**: Direct short without resistor (causes violent arcing, can explode capacitor or weld tools), assume old equipment is safe, touch terminals with bare hands

**CRT (Cathode Ray Tube) televisions and monitors**:
- **Extremely high voltage**: 10,000-30,000 volts in anode cap
- **Can hold charge for months or years**
- **Discharge procedure**: Specialized (requires grounding high-voltage probe under anode cap). **If inexperienced, do not attempt**. Salvage components from outside CRT housing only.
- **Implosion risk**: CRT is vacuum tube. If cracked, implodes violently (glass shrapnel). Handle carefully.

**Batteries** (even old ones):
- Can cause shocks (lead-acid 12V is relatively safe, but higher-voltage battery banks are dangerous)
- Short circuit risk: If terminals touch metal, causes sparks, heat, possible fire
- **Safety**: Insulate terminals with electrical tape, avoid placing in conductive containers

### Biological Hazards
- **Mold and fungus**: Wear masks in enclosed spaces.
- **Animal nests**: Rodents and insects carry disease. Be cautious.
- **Decomposition**: Avoid areas with remains. Disease risk.

### Radiation Hazards
- **Smoke detectors**: Contain americium-241. Small amounts but avoid breaking them.
- **Old gauges**: Some industrial and aircraft instruments use radium or tritium. If it glows in the dark, be very careful.
- **Medical equipment**: X-ray machines and some medical devices contain radioactive materials. Mark and avoid.
- **Industrial sources**: Nuclear density gauges, thickness sensors. Leave these alone unless you have radiation detection equipment.

**Always**: Work in teams. Establish emergency signals. Have first aid ready. Document hazardous locations and warn others.

## Priority Materials for Salvage

### Tier 1: Critical Materials (Salvage First)

**Copper Wire and Cable**
- Location: Electrical wiring in buildings, power distribution cables, electric motors, transformers
- Why critical: Excellent conductor, essential for all electrical work, cannot be easily substituted
- How to extract: Strip insulation (burn in well-ventilated area or use mechanical strippers). Sort by gauge.
- Quantity needed: Hundreds of kilograms for a small community
- Note: Copper oxidizes to green patina but remains usable. Can be cleaned with acid.

**Wire Gauge: Why It Matters**

Wire thickness is measured by gauge (AWG - American Wire Gauge). **Lower gauge number = thicker wire = carries more current.**

**Common gauges and uses:**
- **10-12 gauge** (2.5-3.3mm diameter): Household wiring, appliances, heavy-duty circuits. Can carry 20-30 amps safely. Most useful for power distribution.
- **14-16 gauge** (1.3-1.6mm diameter): Light fixtures, outlets. 10-15 amps. Good for general wiring.
- **18-20 gauge** (0.8-1.0mm diameter): Lamp cords, light-duty appliances. 5-10 amps.
- **22-24 gauge** (0.5-0.6mm diameter): Electronics, circuit boards, low-power signals. 1-5 amps.
- **26-30 gauge** (0.25-0.4mm diameter): Very fine wire in electronics, telephone wiring, delicate work.

**How to identify gauge without markings:**
- **Visual comparison**: Compare to known wire samples
- **Diameter measurement**: Use calipers or micrometer, lookup gauge chart
- **Fit test**: How many strands fit through a given hole/terminal

**Why gauge matters for electrical projects:**
- **Too thin wire** (high gauge) for high current → overheats, melts insulation, fire risk
- **Too thick wire** (low gauge) for terminals → won't fit, difficult to work with (but safe)
- **Rule**: When in doubt, use thicker wire (lower gauge number) for safety

**Sorting priority**: Sort copper by gauge after extraction. Label containers: "Copper 12-gauge, 10kg" etc. This saves time during electrical projects.

**Iron and Steel**
- Location: Vehicles, building frames, rebar, tools, appliances, filing cabinets, shelving
- Why critical: Structural material, tools, machine components
- Types to collect:
  - Mild steel (most common): Easy to work, magnetic
  - Stainless steel (sinks, cookware): Corrosion-resistant, harder to work
  - Tool steel (cutting tools, dies): Can be resharpened and reused
  - Cast iron (engine blocks, pipes): Brittle but machinable
- Quality check: Look for rust. Surface rust is fine, but deeply corroded pieces may be structurally weak.

**Aluminum**
- Location: Window frames, siding, car body panels, aircraft parts, pots and pans
- Why critical: Lightweight, corrosion-resistant, good conductor, low melting point makes it easy to recast
- Note: Different alloys for different purposes. Aircraft aluminum is highest quality.

**Glass**
- Location: Windows, bottles, laboratory glassware, optical lenses
- Why critical: Essential for chemistry, optics, vacuum tubes, displays
- Types:
  - Window glass (soda-lime): Most common
  - Laboratory glassware (borosilicate/Pyrex): Heat-resistant
  - Lenses and optics: High-quality glass with precise shapes
  - Fiber optic cable: Contains ultra-pure glass
- Handling: Wrap carefully to prevent breakage. Sort by type and quality.

**Magnets**
- Location: Loudspeakers, electric motors, hard drives, magnetic latches, refrigerator magnets
- Why critical: Essential for generators, motors, and magnetic data storage. Difficult to manufacture.
- Types:
  - Neodymium (hard drives, modern electronics): Extremely strong
  - Ferrite (ceramic magnets in speakers): Weaker but adequate
  - Alnico (older equipment): Good temperature stability
- Extraction: Hard drives contain multiple small neodymium magnets. Speakers have large ferrite magnets.

### Tier 2: Important Materials

**Precious Metals**
- Gold: Circuit boards (edge connectors, pins), cell phones, computers. Excellent conductor, never corrodes.
- Silver: Older electronics, switches, contacts. Best conductor of all metals.
- Platinum/Palladium: Catalytic converters in vehicles. Needed for certain chemical processes.
- Extraction: Complex chemical process (covered in Chapter 4). Collect electronic scrap first, extract later.

**⚠️ WARNING: Precious metal extraction is NOT backyard chemistry**

The chapter correctly defers extraction to Chapter 4 (Chemistry), but it's critical to understand the danger:

**Gold recovery from electronics** requires either:
1. **Cyanide leaching**: Extremely toxic. Cyanide is a deadly poison (lethal dose <200mg). Requires proper safety equipment, chemical handling training, and waste disposal.
2. **Aqua regia** (concentrated nitric acid + concentrated hydrochloric acid): Highly corrosive mixture, produces toxic nitrogen dioxide gas (brown, causes lung damage). Requires fume hood or outdoor work with respirator, acid-resistant gloves, face shield.

**Both methods require:**
- Proper ventilation (fume hood or outdoor setup)
- Full safety equipment (goggles, face shield, acid-resistant gloves, respirator)
- Emergency response capability (water for washing, neutralizing agents)
- Waste disposal plan (acid waste and cyanide waste are hazardous)

**Do not attempt precious metal extraction without serious safety infrastructure.** Collect electronic scrap, store it, and extract when you have proper chemical facilities (see Chapter 4).

**Alternative**: Focus on reusing electronics intact or salvaging components. The trace gold is less valuable than the functional components.

**Plastics and Polymers**
- Location: Everywhere in modern world
- Types:
  - PET (bottles): Marked with recycling symbol 1. Clear, tough.
  - HDPE (milk jugs, pipes): Symbol 2. Flexible, chemical-resistant.
  - PVC (pipes, vinyl): Symbol 3. Rigid, long-lasting. Contains chlorine.
  - LDPE (bags, squeeze bottles): Symbol 4. Very flexible.
  - PP (containers, car parts): Symbol 5. Heat-resistant.
  - PS (foam, disposable cups): Symbol 6. Insulating.
- Uses: Insulation, containers, seals, chemical resistance

**Plastic Recycling Limitations (Important):**

Not all plastics can be melted and reformed. Understanding the difference is critical.

**Thermoplastics** (CAN be remelted and reshaped):
- PET, HDPE, PVC, LDPE, PP, PS (symbols 1-6 above)
- These soften when heated and can be reformed multiple times
- **Process**: Heat until soft, mold/shape, cool to harden
- **Quality loss**: Each remelting slightly degrades properties (gets more brittle)

**Thermosets** (CANNOT be remelted):
- **Examples**: Epoxy resins, polyurethane (some), phenolic resins (Bakelite), fiberglass-reinforced plastics (many boat hulls, structural parts)
- **Characteristic**: Once cured/hardened, cannot be remelted. Heating causes burning/decomposition, not melting.
- **Why**: Chemical crosslinking creates permanent bonds
- **Salvage value**: Cannot be recycled by melting. Use intact as-is, or grind up for filler material

**Mixed plastic contamination**:
- **Problem**: If different plastic types are melted together, result is weak, brittle, inconsistent material
- **Example**: Melting PET bottles (symbol 1) with HDPE milk jugs (symbol 2) produces poor-quality plastic unsuitable for structural use
- **Solution**: **Keep types strictly separated**. Sort by recycling symbol. Label containers clearly.
- **If mixed**: Only use for low-stress applications (fill material, non-critical parts)

**Identification when symbols worn/missing**:
- **Burn test** (small sample, well-ventilated): Different plastics burn differently (PVC: green flame + chlorine smell, PP: sooty flame, PS: orange flame + sweet smell). Requires experience and is hazardous.
- **Float test**: Density differences (HDPE/PP float in water, PET sinks)
- **When uncertain**: Keep separate until identified, or only use for non-critical applications

**Rubber**
- Location: Tires, hoses, gaskets, belts
- Types:
  - Natural rubber: Older materials, more flexible
  - Synthetic rubber: More durable, fuel-resistant
- Uses: Seals, gaskets, insulation, belts for power transmission
- Note: Degrades over time but remains usable for decades if stored properly.

**Lead**
- Location: Batteries (car, backup power), roofing, old pipes, wheel weights, radiation shielding
- Why important: Batteries (electricity storage), radiation shielding, soft solder, low melting point
- **WARNING**: Highly toxic. Wear gloves. Never heat without ventilation. Wash thoroughly after handling.

**Zinc**
- Location: Galvanized steel (coating), batteries, die-cast parts
- Uses: Corrosion protection, battery electrodes, alloy component (brass = copper + zinc)

### Tier 3: Specialized Components (Salvage Intact When Possible)

**Electronic Components**
Even if you can't manufacture integrated circuits yet, salvage them:
- **Microchips and ICs**: Every computer, phone, modern appliance. May still function. Store in anti-static bags.
- **LEDs**: Indicator lights everywhere. Long-lasting, efficient light sources.
- **Transistors**: Modern electronics have billions. Discrete transistors in older equipment.
- **Capacitors**: Power supplies, electronics. Large ones can store energy. Discharge before handling!
- **Resistors**: Color-coded components in all electronics. Sort by value.
- **Transformers**: Power adapters, electrical equipment. Convert voltage levels.
- **Relays**: Switching devices. Mechanical and solid-state types.

**Solar Panels**
- Location: Rooftops, solar farms, calculators, outdoor lights
- Durability: May function for 20-50 years if undamaged (see Time Decay section above for degradation timeline)
- Priority: High. Free electricity with no fuel required.
- Extraction: Carefully remove glass-faced panels. Avoid cracking. Note voltage and current ratings (usually printed on back label).

**Testing Solar Panels (Multimeter Method):**

Proper testing verifies whether salvaged panels are functional.

**Equipment needed:**
- Multimeter (set to DC voltage and DC current modes)
- Sunlight (bright, direct - midday sun is best)

**Test 1: Open-Circuit Voltage (VOC)**
1. Set multimeter to DC voltage (20V or 200V scale)
2. Place panel in direct sunlight (perpendicular to sun for maximum output)
3. Touch multimeter probes to panel terminals (red to positive, black to negative)
4. Read voltage
5. **Interpretation**:
   - **Nominal 12V panel**: Should read 18-22V in bright sun
   - **Nominal 24V panel**: Should read 36-44V
   - **Significantly lower voltage** (e.g., 12V panel reading 8V): Degraded cells, partial shading, or damaged panel
   - **No voltage**: Panel is dead or connections are broken

**Test 2: Short-Circuit Current (ISC)**
1. Set multimeter to DC current (10A or 20A scale if available; if not, use lower scale briefly)
2. Panel in direct sunlight
3. Touch probes directly to panel terminals (this shorts the panel - safe for testing)
4. Read current
5. **Interpretation**:
   - **Typical residential panels**: 4-8 amps in bright sun (varies by panel size/type)
   - **Smaller panels**: 1-3 amps
   - **Significantly lower current**: Degraded cells, dirt/shading, or partial damage
   - **No current**: Panel dead

**Test 3: Loaded Voltage (Optional but Useful)**
1. Connect panel to a load (12V light bulb, resistor, or battery)
2. Measure voltage while loaded (should drop from VOC but remain substantial)
3. **Good panel**: Voltage drops to 15-18V under load (for nominal 12V panel)
4. **Bad panel**: Voltage collapses to very low value under load

**Visual inspection**:
- Cracks in glass or cells (reduces output)
- Delamination (white spots, bubbles under glass - moisture intrusion, panel is degrading)
- Burned junction box or melted wires (damaged connections)
- Discoloration (yellowing, browning - UV damage, panel degrading)

**Storage after salvage**:
- Store flat or angled, not leaning (prevents glass cracking)
- Protect from impact
- Keep dry (moisture intrusion through cracks accelerates degradation)
- Label with test results: "12V panel, VOC=19.5V, ISC=6.2A, tested Year 3"

**Batteries (If Not Leaked)**
- Lead-acid (car batteries): May be rechargeable if cells aren't damaged
- Lithium (phones, laptops): Dangerous if damaged. Handle carefully. May still hold charge.
- Alkaline (AA, AAA, etc.): Usually dead, but useful to dissect for chemicals
- Note: Battery recycling/refurbishment covered in Chapter 3.

**Motors and Generators**
- Location: Appliances, power tools, HVAC systems, vehicles, industrial equipment
- Why: Motors can be used as generators and vice versa. Contain copper wire, magnets, bearings.
- Types:
  - DC motors: Easier to control, reversible as generators
  - AC induction motors: More robust, common in appliances
  - Stepper motors: Precise positioning (printers, CNC machines)
- Keep intact if possible. Even damaged motors have valuable components.

**Precision Bearings**
- Location: Motors, car wheels, machine tools, hard drives
- Why: Extremely difficult to manufacture with precision. Enable rotating machinery.
- Types: Ball bearings, roller bearings, needle bearings
- Condition: Clean and oil. Even worn bearings are valuable.

**Optics**
- Camera lenses: Precision ground glass
- Binoculars and telescopes: Multiple lenses and prisms
- Microscopes: Essential for quality control in electronics
- Laser pointers: Contain laser diodes
- Fiber optic cables: Data transmission
- CD/DVD drives: Contain laser diodes, precision optics, and stepper motors

**Mechanical Components**
- Springs: Steel springs from vehicles, mattresses, industrial equipment
- Gears: Transmissions, machine tools, clocks
- Chains and sprockets: Bicycles, motorcycles, industrial equipment
- Belts and pulleys: V-belts from cars, timing belts
- Fasteners: Screws, bolts, nuts, rivets (sort by size and type)

**Tools and Measuring Instruments**
- Hand tools: Wrenches, screwdrivers, pliers, hammers
- Cutting tools: Saw blades, drill bits, files
- Measuring tools: Rulers, calipers, micrometers, levels
- Power tools: Drills, grinders, lathes, mills (may still function)
- Priority: Extremely high. These enable building everything else.

**Insulation Materials**
- Fiberglass: Building insulation, heat resistance
- Mineral wool: Fire-resistant insulation
- Ceramic materials: Heat tiles, kiln bricks, spark plug insulators
- Mica sheets: Electrical insulation, heat-resistant

**Cross-Reference: Tool Making and Repair**

Tools are listed as "Extremely high priority" above. This is correct.

**However**: Chapter 2 (Metallurgy and Material Processing) covers repair and eventual manufacture of tools from salvaged metals. Understanding the full tool pipeline is critical:

1. **Salvage** (this chapter): Collect intact tools, broken tools, and tool-making materials
2. **Repair** (Chapter 2): Resharpening, handle replacement, welding broken pieces
3. **Manufacture** (Chapter 2): Forging new tools from salvaged steel when salvage depleted

**Prioritize salvage of**:
- Working tools (immediate use)
- Broken tools (can be repaired - see Chapter 2)
- Tool steel (for making new tools - see Chapter 2)
- Machine tools (lathes, mills - enable precision work)

A single working lathe is worth more than a ton of scrap steel. Prioritize salvaging functional manufacturing equipment above almost everything else.

## Fuel Salvage: Early-Window Critical Resource

**Fuel degrades. The window to salvage usable fuel is Years 0-5 maximum (see Time Decay section above).**

### Gasoline (Shortest Lifespan: 1-2 Years)

**Degradation process**:
- Oxidation: Reacts with oxygen, forms gums and varnish
- Evaporation: Volatile components evaporate, leaving heavy residue
- Timeline: Unusable for engines after 1-2 years (clogs carburetors, won't ignite properly)

**How to test salvaged gasoline**:
1. **Visual inspection**: Pour small amount into clear container
   - Good gasoline: Clear or light amber, no particles
   - Bad gasoline: Dark brown, cloudy, visible sediment, gel-like consistency
2. **Smell test**: Fresh gasoline has sharp, recognizable odor. Degraded gasoline smells like varnish or paint thinner.
3. **Water test**: Gasoline floats on water. If it doesn't separate cleanly, it's contaminated.
4. **Small engine test** (if safe): Use in lawnmower or small engine first. If it runs roughly or won't start, gasoline is bad.

**Salvage strategy**:
- **Years 0-1**: Gasoline still usable. Prioritize salvage from gas stations, vehicle tanks, fuel cans.
- **Years 1-2**: Marginal. Test before use. May work in less-sensitive engines (generators).
- **Years 2+**: Mostly unusable for engines. Can potentially be used as solvent or fire-starter (extreme caution - still flammable).

**Storage after salvage**:
- Sealed metal or approved plastic containers (not all plastics resist gasoline)
- Cool location (heat accelerates degradation)
- Add fuel stabilizer if available (extends life to 2-3 years)
- Label with salvage date

### Diesel (Medium Lifespan: 2-10 Years)

**Degradation process**:
- Slower oxidation than gasoline
- Biological growth (algae, bacteria) if water contamination present
- Wax formation in cold temperatures
- Timeline: 2-3 years without stabilizers, 5-10 years with stabilizers

**How to test salvaged diesel**:
1. **Visual inspection**:
   - Good diesel: Clear to light amber, no cloudiness
   - Bad diesel: Dark, cloudy, visible particles or slime (biological growth)
2. **Water separation**: Diesel should not contain visible water layer (settles at bottom)
3. **Filter test**: Pour through clean cloth or coffee filter. Excessive sediment indicates degradation.
4. **Smell**: Fresh diesel has distinct petroleum odor. Rotten/sulfur smell indicates biological contamination.

**Salvage strategy**:
- **Years 0-2**: Excellent condition, high priority
- **Years 2-5**: Still usable, test and filter
- **Years 5-10**: May be usable after filtering and testing
- **Years 10+**: Likely degraded, but test anyway (some diesel survives longer in good conditions)

**Storage after salvage**:
- Metal containers preferred (plastic deteriorates over time with diesel)
- Add biocide if available (prevents biological growth)
- Add fuel stabilizer (significantly extends lifespan)
- Keep water out (water accelerates biological growth)

### Propane/Natural Gas (Longest Lifespan: Decades)

**Advantages**:
- **Does not degrade chemically** (propane and natural gas are stable)
- Lifespan limited only by container integrity
- Timeline: 20-50+ years if tanks undamaged

**How to test salvaged propane tanks**:
1. **Check for leaks**:
   - Smell near valves (propane has added odorant - smells like rotten eggs/sulfur)
   - Soapy water test: Apply soapy water to connections, bubbles indicate leak
2. **Check tank integrity**:
   - Rust, dents, damage (compromised tanks are dangerous)
   - Valve condition (frozen or damaged valves may leak)
3. **Pressure check**: If tank has gauge, should show pressure if full

**Salvage locations**:
- BBQ grills (small 20 lb tanks)
- RVs and campers (30-40 lb tanks)
- Home heating systems (100-500 gallon tanks)
- Forklifts (industrial propane tanks)

**Safety**:
- Propane is heavier than air (sinks, accumulates in low areas)
- Extremely flammable (explosive risk)
- Handle valves carefully (don't force frozen valves)
- Transport upright, secured

**Priority**: Very high. Propane lasts decades and can fuel generators, heaters, cooking, and some vehicles (with conversion).

### Motor Oil and Hydraulic Fluid (Long Lifespan: Years to Decades)

**Degradation**:
- Slow oxidation
- Contamination (moisture, particles)
- Separation of additives
- Timeline: Sealed containers can last 5-20+ years; opened containers degrade faster

**Testing**:
- Visual: Should be clear to amber (not black/sludgy unless used oil)
- Consistency: Should pour smoothly (not thick/gummy)
- Separation: No visible layer separation

**Uses**:
- Lubrication (machines, tools, engines)
- Hydraulic systems
- Can be refined/filtered for reuse

**Salvage**: Moderate priority. Useful but not urgent (degrades slowly).

### Fuel Stabilization (If Salvaging Early)

**If salvaging fuel in Years 0-2 and want to extend lifespan**:

1. **Add commercial fuel stabilizer** (if available):
   - Gasoline: Add stabilizer, extends life to 2-3 years
   - Diesel: Add stabilizer + biocide, extends life to 10+ years
2. **Store properly**:
   - Sealed containers (minimize oxygen exposure)
   - Cool, dark location (heat and UV accelerate degradation)
   - Full containers (less air = less oxidation)
3. **Periodic inspection**:
   - Check for leaks, rust on containers
   - Test sample annually

**Reality check**: Even with stabilization, fuel is finite. Use salvaged fuel strategically:
- Critical early-window transportation (moving heavy salvage)
- Generator power for urgent projects
- Transition vehicles/generators to alternative fuels as soon as possible (see Chapter 3 for wood gasification, Chapter 4 for biofuels)

**Do not become dependent on salvaged fuel.** It will run out. Treat it as temporary advantage to accelerate early salvage operations.

## Transportation Logistics: Moving Salvaged Materials

**Reality: Salvaged materials are heavy. Moving hundreds of kilograms of copper, steel, or equipment without functioning vehicles is the limiting factor in salvage operations.**

The chapter mentions "vehicles for transport" but doesn't address the hard truth: fuel degrades (see above), and vehicle-powered transport is temporary.

### Human-Powered Transport

**Hand Carts and Wheelbarrows**

**Load capacity**:
- Wheelbarrow: 30-60 kg typically (one person, short distances)
- Two-wheeled hand cart: 100-150 kg (one person, paved/smooth surfaces)
- Four-wheeled cart: 200-400 kg (one-two people, depends on wheels and surface)

**Caloric cost**:
- Pushing 100 kg cart 1 km on smooth surface: ~100-150 kcal (person consumes)
- Uphill or rough terrain: 2-3x more energy
- **Implication**: Moving 1 ton of copper 10 km by hand cart = 20+ person-hours and 2,000-3,000 kcal energy expenditure
- **Food cost**: Workers need additional food to fuel this labor (see Chapter 0.5 on caloric requirements)

**Efficiency improvements**:
- Pneumatic (air-filled) tires: Easier rolling than solid wheels
- Paved/smooth paths: Reduce friction massively compared to dirt/grass
- Wheels from bicycles, cars: Salvage good wheels/bearings for carts

**Salvage carts from**:
- Shopping carts (ubiquitous, decent wheels)
- Industrial dollies and pallet jacks
- Wheelbarrows (obvious)
- Strollers and hand-carts (many varieties)
- Build custom carts using salvaged wheels + wood/metal frame

### Bicycle-Based Transport

**Bicycle Trailers**

**Load capacity**: 40-80 kg (depending on trailer and bicycle strength)

**Advantages**:
- Much less energy per kg per km than hand-pushing
- One person can move significant loads (60 kg) 20-30 km in a day
- Faster than walking/pushing

**Salvage or build**:
- Commercial bicycle trailers (camping/touring trailers)
- Build from bicycle wheels + frame (see Chapter 2.9 for basic metalworking)
- Child trailers (not designed for cargo but adaptable)

**Limitations**:
- Requires paved/smooth surfaces (dirt roads are difficult)
- Hills are challenging with heavy loads
- Bicycle maintenance required (tires, chains, bearings)

**Cargo Bicycles**

- Front-loading cargo bikes (bakfiets style): 50-100 kg capacity
- Long-tail cargo bikes: 60-80 kg
- Salvage from: Delivery bikes, commercial cargo bikes

### Draft Animal Transport (If Available)

**Horses, Mules, Donkeys, Oxen** (covered in Chapter 0.5 - Agriculture)

**Load capacity** (cart/wagon):
- Single horse: 200-400 kg in cart
- Ox team (2 oxen): 500-1,000 kg in wagon
- **Massive improvement** over human-powered transport

**Caloric cost**:
- Animals consume food (hay, grain) but per-kg efficiency much better than human labor
- Horse can move 300 kg 20 km in a day with modest food input
- Human crew moving same load would require multiple people, days of work, enormous caloric expenditure

**Timeline**:
- Years 0-5: Salvage takes priority, may not have draft animals yet
- Years 5-10: If agricultural surplus established (Chapter 0.5), draft animals become feasible and transform salvage logistics

### Waterway Transport (If Accessible)

**Rivers, Canals, Lakes, Coastal Waters**

**Advantages**:
- Extremely low energy cost per ton-km
- Small raft/boat can move hundreds of kg with minimal effort (floating cargo, not carrying it)
- Rowing, poling, or sailing requires modest energy

**Salvage boats and materials**:
- Small boats (aluminum fishing boats, rowboats)
- Canoes and kayaks (light cargo)
- Build rafts from salvaged barrels/drums (float platform)
- Inflatable boats (if still airtight)

**Limitations**:
- Only works if salvage site is near waterway
- Loading/unloading still requires manual labor
- Seasonal (frozen water, dry seasons)

**Use case**: If urban salvage area has river access, boat transport can move orders of magnitude more material than land transport with same labor.

### Salvaging and Repairing Vehicles (Temporary Solution)

**Fuel-powered vehicles work in Years 0-5 (while fuel still usable)**

**Salvage priorities**:
1. **Working vehicles** (running when salvaged): Immediate use
2. **Repairable vehicles** (dead battery, minor issues): Fix with salvaged parts
3. **Parts vehicles** (too damaged to repair): Scavenge batteries, alternators, wheels, etc.

**Fuel efficiency matters**:
- Diesel vehicles preferred (diesel lasts longer than gasoline)
- Motorcycles/scooters: Excellent fuel efficiency for light cargo
- Pickup trucks: Best cargo capacity for fuel consumption

**Maintenance**:
- Salvage spare parts (batteries, belts, hoses, filters, tires)
- Oil and fluids (from other vehicles)
- Repair manuals (critical - salvage from libraries, bookstores)

**Reality**: Vehicle-powered salvage is a 5-10 year window. Use it aggressively early to move heavy materials while fuel lasts. Transition to animal/human power as fuel depletes.

### Strategic Implications

**Distance from salvage site matters enormously:**

- **<1 km**: Hand carts, wheelbarrows feasible
- **1-5 km**: Bicycle trailers, animal carts (if available)
- **5-20 km**: Vehicles (while fuel available), animal wagons, waterways
- **>20 km**: Only worth it for extremely high-value items or if vehicle/water transport available

**Prioritize nearby salvage first**:
- Suburban homes within 1-5 km: Accessible by hand/bicycle
- Urban centers 20+ km away: May require vehicle-based expeditions in Years 0-5, or establishing temporary salvage camps

**Establish salvage outposts**:
- For distant high-value sites (e.g., industrial park 30 km away), consider:
  - Temporary camp near site (reduces daily travel)
  - Process materials on-site (strip copper from wires there, transport only refined copper - reduces weight)
  - Batch trips (spend week salvaging, one large transport run)

**Caloric accounting** (see Chapter 0.5):
- Moving 1 ton of steel 10 km by hand cart might consume 20,000-30,000 kcal of human energy
- That's 10-15 days of food for one person
- **Is the salvaged material worth the food cost?** Sometimes yes (copper, precision tools). Sometimes no (bulk scrap metal when food is scarce).

## Contested Salvage and Territorial Issues

**In realistic collapse scenarios, valuable salvage sites will be claimed, guarded, or fought over.**

The chapter has focused on material science and extraction techniques. But the social/political reality of salvage can be more challenging than the technical aspects.

### Recognition: Salvage Sites Will Be Claimed

**High-value locations** (machine shops, warehouses, electronics factories, hardware stores, military bases):
- Other communities will recognize value
- Some communities will claim territory, guard it, or refuse access
- Some will demand payment/barter for access

**Expect**:
- Marked territories ("This area claimed by [Community Name]")
- Guards at valuable sites (armed or unarmed)
- Competing salvage teams from different communities

**This is rational behavior**: Salvage is survival resource. Communities that secure high-value salvage have better rebuilding prospects.

### Negotiating Access to Salvage Sites

**If another community has claimed a site you need access to:**

**Option 1: Trade for access rights**
- Offer: Food, labor, other salvaged materials, knowledge, medical services
- Negotiate: "We'll help you salvage this building if we can take 30% of materials"
- Formalize: Clear agreement on who gets what (prevents conflict)

**Option 2: Trade for already-salvaged materials**
- If they've already salvaged what you need: Barter directly for materials
- May be easier than negotiating access (they've already done the work)

**Option 3: Cooperative salvage**
- Propose joint operation: "You have guards, we have tools and expertise. Let's salvage together and split materials."
- Benefits both: More efficient, reduces conflict risk, builds relationships

**Option 4: Accept denial and move on**
- Some communities will refuse regardless of offers
- **Don't escalate to violence over salvage** (risk lives for materials = bad trade)
- Focus on other sites, negotiate later when you have more leverage

### Avoiding Conflict

**Conflict over salvage is catastrophic for both sides**: People die, resources wasted, future cooperation impossible.

**De-escalation strategies**:

1. **Announce presence**: Don't sneak into claimed areas. Approach openly, ask permission.
2. **Respect boundaries**: If they say no, leave peacefully. Don't antagonize.
3. **Offer value**: Frame as trade, not taking. Everyone benefits from cooperation.
4. **Build relationships**: Small trade now → larger cooperation later. Play long game.
5. **Document agreements**: Written agreements prevent misunderstandings (who gets what, when, how much).

**Red flags for escalation** (leave immediately if you see these):
- Armed guards acting aggressively
- Warnings ignored by your team (never ignore a "leave now" warning)
- Salvage site is fortified (walls, barriers) - indicates serious territorial claim
- Evidence of recent violence (bodies, blood, spent casings)

### Recognizing When a Site Is Too Dangerous (Socially)

**Some sites are not worth the risk, regardless of material value.**

**Avoid**:
1. **Military bases**: May still have guards, active defenses, or be claimed by armed groups. Ordnance risk (unexploded munitions).
2. **Government buildings**: Similar issues - may be occupied, claimed, or dangerous.
3. **Heavily fortified commercial sites**: If someone built walls and posted armed guards, they're serious. Don't challenge unless you have equivalent force (which likely means violence).
4. **Sites with recent conflict**: Evidence of fighting (bodies, barricades, damage) means active territorial dispute. Stay out.
5. **Unknown group territories**: If you don't know who controls an area, scout carefully before entering with salvage team.

**Social danger vs. structural danger**:
- Structural danger: Building collapse, chemical hazards (covered earlier)
- Social danger: Armed conflict, territorial disputes, bandit ambushes

**Both kill you. Treat social danger as seriously as structural danger.**

### When Violence Is NOT Worth It

**Salvage materials are valuable. Human lives are irreplaceable.**

**Do NOT**:
- Attack other communities for salvage access
- Defend salvage sites with lethal force (unless directly threatened)
- Risk team members' lives for replaceable materials

**Why**:
- Killed workers = permanent loss of labor, skill, and genetics (population bottleneck - see Introduction on population thresholds)
- Conflict destroys trust = prevents future cooperation (which is more valuable than any salvage site)
- Violence escalates = blood feuds last generations
- You can always find alternative salvage, build alternatives, or negotiate later

**Only exception**: Defense of your own community's core territory/resources from invasion. But salvage sites in neutral or disputed territory? Not worth dying for.

### Establishing Community Salvage Protocols

**Your community should decide salvage policy before conflicts arise:**

1. **What counts as "our territory"**?
   - Within X km of settlement?
   - Sites we actively guard?
   - First-claimed?

2. **How do we respond to competing claims**?
   - Negotiate first
   - Share sites
   - Accept some losses

3. **When do we use force**?
   - Defense only?
   - Never over salvage?
   - Establish clear rules

4. **How do we trade with other communities**?
   - What do we offer?
   - What do we need most?
   - Who negotiates?

**Clear internal policy prevents impulsive violent decisions by salvage teams in the field.**

## Salvage Team Composition

**Effective salvage requires different skills. A 4-6 person team with complementary skills is more effective than 6 generalists.**

### Recommended Team Roles

**1. Structural Assessment Specialist**
- **Skills needed**: Basic engineering, construction experience, understands load-bearing structures
- **Role**: Determines if building is safe to enter, identifies collapse risks, plans safe extraction routes
- **Why critical**: Prevents team deaths from collapses. Can say "no" if too dangerous.
- **Can be same person as**: Mechanic (overlapping spatial/structural reasoning)

**2. Electrical Specialist**
- **Skills needed**: Understanding of electrical systems, can identify wire types, knows how to safely discharge capacitors, recognizes valuable components
- **Role**: Identifies wiring, safely extracts electrical components, assesses solar panels/batteries, prevents electrical injuries
- **Why critical**: Electricity can kill. Specialized knowledge maximizes valuable salvage from electrical systems.

**3. Mechanical/Tool Specialist**
- **Skills needed**: Mechanical aptitude, tool use, disassembly skills
- **Role**: Extracts motors, gears, bearings, operates salvaged power tools (if available), maintains team tools
- **Why critical**: Mechanical systems are complex. Specialist extracts components intact rather than destroying them.
- **Can be same person as**: Structural specialist

**4. Logistics/Documentation Specialist**
- **Skills needed**: Organization, writing, memory, inventory management
- **Role**: Documents what's salvaged (location, quantity, type), maintains salvage catalog, plans transport, tracks team supplies
- **Why critical**: Without documentation, salvage is chaotic. Catalog enables finding materials later.

**5-6. General Laborers / Security**
- **Skills needed**: Physical strength, willingness to work, can follow safety protocols
- **Role**: Carry materials, provide extra hands for heavy lifting, watch for hazards, provide security if needed
- **Why needed**: Salvage is physically demanding. Extra hands speed operations.

### Team Size Trade-offs

**Smaller teams (2-3 people)**:
- Advantages: Quieter, less food consumption, easier coordination
- Disadvantages: Limited carrying capacity, harder to handle heavy items, less specialized knowledge
- Best for: Scouting, lightweight salvage (electronics, small tools)

**Medium teams (4-6 people)**:
- Advantages: Balance of skills, can handle heavy items, redundancy if someone injured
- Disadvantages: More food/water needed, more noise
- Best for: General salvage operations (most situations)

**Large teams (7-12 people)**:
- Advantages: Can move very heavy equipment, process sites quickly, intimidating presence (deters threats)
- Disadvantages: Requires significant food, coordination complexity, attracts attention
- Best for: High-value sites requiring heavy lifting, contested areas requiring security, urgent time-sensitive salvage

### Cross-Training and Redundancy

**Critical**: Skills should overlap. If your only electrical specialist gets injured or dies, team loses that capability.

**Solution**:
- Primary specialist + apprentice learning the skill
- Documentation of techniques (written guides team carries)
- Rotate roles when safe (laborers learn some electrical basics, etc.)

**Minimum redundancy**: 2 people who can perform critical safety roles (structural assessment, electrical discharge).

### Team Safety Protocols

**Before entering salvage site**:
1. Team lead briefs: Today's objectives, known hazards, emergency signals
2. Structural specialist assesses building exterior
3. Plan emergency evacuation routes
4. Establish check-in schedule ("Call out every 15 minutes to confirm you're OK")
5. Pair system: No one works alone (if one injured, partner calls for help)

**During salvage**:
- Regular communication (shouted check-ins, whistles, radios if available)
- Watch for hazards (falling debris, chemical smells, structural creaking)
- If anyone says "evacuate", everyone leaves immediately (no questions, no delay)

**After salvage**:
- Headcount (ensure everyone exited)
- Document day's salvage (materials collected, quantities, location for future reference)
- Check for injuries (treat minor injuries, plan for medical care if serious)
- Decontamination if needed (asbestos exposure, chemical contact)

**Emergency signals**:
- Three whistle blasts: Emergency, evacuate now
- Continuous shouting: Someone injured, need help
- [Establish others as needed based on available tools]

## What NOT to Salvage

**Some materials are too dangerous to salvage. Explicit "leave it alone" guidance prevents well-meaning but lethal recovery attempts.**

### DO NOT SALVAGE

**1. Transformer Oil (May Contain PCBs)**
- **Found in**: Large electrical transformers (utility poles, substations)
- **Danger**: Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are extremely toxic, carcinogenic, persistent in environment
- **Identification**: Dark oily liquid in large metal transformer housings
- **Why tempting**: Oil seems useful for lubrication
- **Reality**: Pre-1979 transformers often contain PCB oil. No safe way to distinguish PCB oil from mineral oil in field.
- **Action**: Avoid all transformer oil unless you have laboratory analysis capability.

**2. Medical Radioactive Sources**
- **Found in**: Hospitals, clinics, cancer treatment facilities
- **Examples**: Cobalt-60 sources (radiotherapy), Cesium-137, Iridium-192
- **Danger**: Intense radiation, lethal exposure within hours to days
- **Identification**: Often in lead-shielded containers, may have radiation trefoil symbol
- **Why tempting**: Metal shielding, interesting equipment
- **Reality**: Even brief exposure can be lethal. Many post-Soviet collapse incidents of people dying from salvaged medical radiation sources.
- **Action**: If you find equipment with radiation symbols, MARK THE LOCATION, LEAVE IMMEDIATELY, WARN OTHERS. Do not approach.

**3. Unlabeled Industrial Chemicals**
- **Found in**: Factories, laboratories, chemical plants, warehouses
- **Examples**: Concentrated acids, bases, oxidizers, toxins, carcinogens, explosive precursors
- **Danger**: Burns, poisoning, explosions, long-term health effects
- **Why tempting**: "Maybe it's useful?"
- **Reality**: Without labels and safety data sheets (MSDS), you can't safely identify or use industrial chemicals. Mixing unknown chemicals can cause violent reactions.
- **Action**: If clearly labeled and you know what it is, maybe. If unknown, leave it. Mark location for future reference if your community gains chemistry capability.

**4. Visibly Damaged Lithium Batteries**
- **Found in**: Laptops, cell phones, power tools, electric vehicles
- **Damage signs**: Swollen, punctured, crushed, corroded, burnt, leaking
- **Danger**: Can ignite violently, burn at 1,000°F+, toxic fumes, nearly impossible to extinguish
- **Why tempting**: Batteries = electrical storage
- **Reality**: Damaged lithium batteries are incendiary devices. They can ignite hours or days after damage.
- **Action**: If battery is swollen or damaged, do not transport, do not store indoors, do not attempt to salvage. Undamaged lithium batteries can be salvaged carefully, but damaged ones are too dangerous.

**5. Pressurized Gas Cylinders (Unknown Contents)**
- **Found in**: Laboratories, industrial sites, welding shops, medical facilities
- **Examples**: Oxygen, acetylene, nitrogen, chlorine, ammonia, specialty gases
- **Danger**: Unknown gas may be toxic, flammable, oxidizing, or corrosive; pressure makes cylinders explosive if damaged
- **Why tempting**: Metal cylinders, maybe useful gas inside
- **Reality**: Without label, you don't know if it's inert nitrogen or deadly chlorine. Pressurized cylinders are bombs if heated or punctured.
- **Action**: Only salvage clearly labeled cylinders with recognized contents (oxygen, propane, nitrogen, argon, CO2). Unknown cylinders = leave alone.

**6. Munitions and Explosives**
- **Found in**: Military bases, police stations, gun ranges, construction sites (dynamite), vehicles (airbag inflators)
- **Examples**: Ammunition, grenades, land mines, artillery shells, blasting caps, dynamite
- **Danger**: Explosive. Unstable when corroded or damaged.
- **Why tempting**: Gunpowder/explosives useful for construction, mining?
- **Reality**: Old explosives become unstable. Corrosion makes them sensitive to shock. Many people die each year from salvaging old munitions.
- **Action**: If you find military ord nance, explosives, or large ammunition stores: MARK, LEAVE, WARN. Do NOT attempt to salvage, disarm, or move. Exception: Small amounts of common ammunition (rifle/pistol cartridges) can be carefully salvaged if undamaged and you know what you're doing.

**7. Mercury (From Thermometers, Switches, Fluorescent Bulbs)**
- **Found in**: Old thermometers, fluorescent lights, some electrical switches, industrial equipment
- **Danger**: Toxic heavy metal, accumulates in body, causes neurological damage
- **Why tempting**: Shiny, liquid metal seems interesting
- **Reality**: Mercury vapor is toxic. Skin contact causes absorption. Spilled mercury contaminates area for years.
- **Action**: Avoid salvaging mercury-containing devices. If broken, ventilate area and leave. Small amounts in thermometers aren't immediately lethal but avoid handling.

### General Rule: If You Don't Know What It Is, Leave It

**Post-collapse salvage is trial-and-error, but chemical/radiological/explosive hazards are NOT forgiving.**

**Safe salvage**:
- Metals (copper, steel, aluminum, etc.)
- Electronics and components
- Mechanical parts
- Tools
- Glass and ceramics
- Building materials

**Risky salvage** (proceed with caution and knowledge):
- Chemicals (only if labeled and you understand them)
- Batteries (inspect for damage)
- Fuel (test for degradation)
- Pressurized containers (only if clearly labeled)

**Never salvage**:
- Radioactive materials
- Unknown chemicals
- Damaged lithium batteries
- Unknown pressurized cylinders
- Explosives/munitions
- PCB-containing equipment

**When in doubt, mark it, document it, leave it, and ask someone more knowledgeable later.**

## Geographic Salvage Priorities

### Urban Areas
**Advantages**: Dense concentration of materials, variety of buildings and equipment
**Disadvantages**: May be dangerous, contested, or radioactive (if weapons were used)

**Best salvage locations**:
1. **Suburbs**: Lower danger, still lots of materials in homes
2. **Industrial parks**: Machine shops, electronics manufacturers, warehouses
3. **Commercial areas**: Offices have copper wire, computers, HVAC systems
4. **Scrapyards**: Pre-sorted materials, though may be picked over
5. **Landfills**: Messy but enormous material reserves

### Rural Areas
**Advantages**: Agricultural equipment, spread-out buildings, often less damaged
**Disadvantages**: Lower material density, more travel needed

**Best salvage locations**:
1. **Farms**: Tractors, tools, diesel generators, electric motors, fuel tanks
2. **Small towns**: Hardware stores, garages, grain elevators
3. **Mines**: Equipment, explosives (careful!), processed ores
4. **Power infrastructure**: Transformers, transmission lines (dangerous voltage may remain!)

### Coastal Areas
**Advantages**: Shipping ports, naval facilities, maritime equipment
**Disadvantages**: Salt corrosion, potential flooding

**Best salvage locations**:
1. **Ports**: Cranes, containers (good storage), ships
2. **Boats**: Aluminum and fiberglass hulls, marine electronics, batteries
3. **Desalination plants**: Pumps, filters, industrial equipment

### Specialized Facilities (If Accessible)

**Airports**
- Aircraft: Aluminum alloys, titanium, precision instruments, radios, turbine blades
- Ground equipment: Generators, fuel pumps, tools
- Note: Some aircraft parts may be classified or hazardous (composites, exotic materials)

**Hospitals**
- Medical equipment: Stainless steel, precision instruments, computers, backup generators
- Laboratories: Glassware, chemicals (may still be usable), microscopes
- **WARNING**: Biological hazards, radioactive materials in imaging equipment, pharmaceutical chemicals

**Universities and Research Labs**
- High-quality instruments: Oscilloscopes, spectrometers, precision balances
- Computers and servers: May be more powerful than consumer equipment
- Libraries: Books and documentation (preserve these!)
- Machine shops: Lathes, mills, precision tools

**Data Centers**
- Servers: Dense concentration of electronics, copper, gold
- Batteries: Backup power systems, often large battery banks
- Cooling: Copper piping, pumps, heat exchangers
- Fiber optics: High-bandwidth cables

**Telecommunications Facilities**
- Cell towers: Radios, antennas, backup power systems
- Central offices: Switching equipment, fiber optics, copper lines
- Satellite dishes: Parabolic reflectors (useful for solar concentrators)

## Salvage Strategies

### Documentation
Before you take anything, document:
1. **Location**: Map it. You may need to return.
2. **Quantity**: Estimate available materials.
3. **Hazards**: Note dangers for future teams.
4. **Access**: How to get equipment in and out.

Create a salvage catalog:
```
Location: 123 Main Street, Commercial Building
Date Surveyed: [Date]
Structure Condition: Stable, west wall damaged
Hazards: Asbestos in ceiling tiles (2nd floor), mold in basement
Priority Materials:
  - Copper wire: ~50 kg (estimated) in walls and ceiling
  - Computers: 12 desktop PCs, various ages
  - HVAC system: 2 large units on roof, copper coils intact
  - Solar panels: 20 panels on roof, condition unknown
Access: Loading dock on north side, clear
Notes: Bring wire strippers, hand trucks, containers for components
```

### Systematic Extraction

**For a Building**:
1. **Exterior first**: Solar panels, HVAC units, external wiring, lightning rods
2. **Roof**: Flashing (metal), vents, additional HVAC
3. **Utilities**: Electrical panel, water heater, furnace, plumbing
4. **High-value rooms**:
   - Server rooms: Computers, networking equipment
   - Workshops: Tools, materials
   - Kitchens: Appliances, copper pipes, stainless steel
5. **Systematic stripping**: Work floor by floor, room by room
6. **Structural**: After all else is salvaged, consider rebar, structural steel

**For a Vehicle**:
1. **Battery**: May still be functional. Careful of acid.
2. **Alternator**: Generates electricity, contains copper and magnets.
3. **Starter motor**: Strong DC motor.
4. **Radiator**: Copper and aluminum, lots of it.
5. **Catalytic converter**: Contains platinum, palladium, rhodium.
6. **Wiring harness**: Hundreds of meters of copper wire.
7. **Computer modules**: Engine control unit, body control modules.
8. **Sensors**: Oxygen sensors, temperature sensors, etc.
9. **Lights**: LEDs in newer vehicles, bulbs in older ones.
10. **Body panels**: Aluminum or steel, depending on vehicle.
11. **Glass**: Windows, mirrors.
12. **Tires**: Rubber for various uses.

### Storage and Organization

Salvaged materials must be stored properly:

**Metals**:
- Sort by type: copper, aluminum, steel, stainless, brass, etc.
- Further sort by form: wire, sheet, structural, fasteners
- Storage: Keep dry to prevent corrosion. Oil steel to prevent rust.
- Label everything: "Copper Wire, 12-gauge, 15 kg, from 123 Main St."

**Electronics**:
- Anti-static: Store ICs and circuit boards in anti-static bags or wrap in aluminum foil
- Dry: Moisture causes corrosion
- Organized: Sort by type (capacitors, resistors, ICs, etc.)
- Documented: Note what device it came from if possible

**Glass**:
- Wrapped: Newspaper, cloth, or cardboard
- Separated: Don't let pieces touch
- Sorted: Laboratory glass separate from window glass
- Vertical storage: Less likely to break

**Chemicals and Batteries**:
- Ventilated: Fumes can build up
- Separate: Acids away from bases, flammables isolated
- Labeled: Clearly mark contents and hazards
- Contained: Double-contain anything that could leak
- Cool and dry: Extends shelf life

**Tools and Instruments**:
- Clean: Remove rust, oil moving parts
- Protected: Cases or wrapping to prevent damage
- Organized: Tool storage where items can be found quickly
- Maintained: Sharpen cutting tools, calibrate measuring instruments if possible

## Initial Salvage Priorities for a Starting Community

If you're just beginning, focus on this order:

**Week 1: Immediate Needs**
1. Hand tools (you need these to salvage everything else)
2. Containers (storage for salvage)
3. Solar panels and batteries (power for light and small tools)
4. Water containers and pipes
5. Wire and cable (copper)

**Month 1: Foundation Building**
1. More copper wire (hundreds of kg)
2. Steel and iron (structural materials)
3. Power tools (if you have electricity to run them)
4. Vehicles for transport (even if not running, can be repaired)
5. Machine tools (lathes, mills, drills)

**Year 1: Technology Base**
1. All electronic components you can find
2. Magnets, motors, and generators
3. Precision instruments and optics
4. Specialized materials (ceramics, refractories, insulation)
5. Chemical stockpiles (acids, bases, solvents)
6. Complete systems: computers, radios, test equipment

## Testing and Quality Control

Not all salvaged materials are usable:

**Metals**:
- Visual: Cracks, deep corrosion, or deformation may indicate weakness
- Magnet test: Distinguishes ferrous (magnetic) from non-ferrous metals
- Spark test: Different metals produce different sparks when ground (requires experience)
- File test: Hardness and texture indicate metal type
- Density: Weight vs. size can identify metals (gold is very heavy for its size)

**Electronics**:
- Visual: Look for burns, bulging capacitors, cracked components
- Multimeter: Test resistors, capacitors, diodes
- Power test: Carefully apply power to circuits, monitor for smoke or heat
- Note: Many components will still be good even if the device doesn't work

**Batteries**:
- Voltage test: Should be near rated voltage if good
- Load test: Connect to load, measure voltage drop
- Physical: Swelling, leaking, or damage means discard or recycle
- Lead-acid: Check electrolyte level and specific gravity if possible

**Wire and Cable**:
- Insulation: Cracked or brittle insulation should be stripped or replaced
- Conductor: Verify copper vs. aluminum (copper is more valuable)
- Corrosion: Green (copper) or white (aluminum) oxidation. Can be cleaned.

## Long-Term Salvage Consideration

**The salvage won't last forever.** Eventually, you'll have picked over the ruins. This is why manufacturing capability is critical. Use the initial salvage period (probably decades) to:

1. Build manufacturing capability while materials are available
2. Prioritize hard-to-make items (precision instruments, complex electronics)
3. Recycle and reuse everything possible
4. Establish mining and refining for post-salvage era

Think of salvage as a temporary advantage—a gift from the old world to help you rebuild. Use it wisely.

## Summary Checklist

**Before entering a salvage site**:
- [ ] Assess structural stability
- [ ] Identify hazards (chemical, electrical, biological, radiological)
- [ ] Bring appropriate safety equipment
- [ ] Work in teams with communication
- [ ] Have evacuation plan

**Priority salvage order**:
1. Tools and instruments
2. Copper wire and cable
3. Solar panels and batteries
4. Electronic components
5. Iron and steel
6. Aluminum and other metals
7. Motors and generators
8. Glass and optics
9. Specialized materials

**After salvage**:
- [ ] Document what was taken and what remains
- [ ] Sort and organize materials
- [ ] Store properly with labels
- [ ] Test quality of salvaged materials
- [ ] Update salvage catalog

**Next steps**: With materials secured, proceed to Chapter 2 to learn how to work these metals into useful forms, and Chapter 3 to begin generating electricity from your salvaged components.

Remember: Safety first, documentation second, efficiency third. A killed or injured worker is a permanent loss to your community. Patience and care will serve you better than speed.
