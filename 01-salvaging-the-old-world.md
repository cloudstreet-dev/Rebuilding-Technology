# Chapter 1: Salvaging the Old World

## Why Salvage Matters

The collapsed civilization of 2025 left behind an incredible treasure: billions of tons of refined materials. Mining copper ore and smelting it takes enormous energy and infrastructure. A single abandoned car contains 20-30 kg of steel, 10-15 kg of iron, 10-20 kg of aluminum, 1-2 kg of copper, and smaller amounts of zinc, lead, and precious metals.

**Core principle**: Never mine what you can salvage. The energy cost of extraction and refinement has already been paid.

## Safety First: Hazards in the Ruins

Before you begin salvaging, understand the dangers:

### Structural Hazards
- **Collapsed buildings**: Can collapse further. Never enter alone. Use support beams.
- **Unstable floors**: Rot and corrosion weaken structures. Test every step.
- **Falling debris**: Wear hard hats. Be aware of overhead hazards.

### Chemical Hazards
- **Asbestos**: Common in pre-2000 buildings (insulation, floor tiles, roofing). Causes lung cancer. Wear respirators. Wet it before disturbing.
- **Lead paint**: In older buildings. Wear gloves. Don't burn it.
- **Refrigerants**: CFCs and other coolants in refrigerators and air conditioners. Toxic when heated.
- **Batteries**: Lead-acid, lithium, and alkaline batteries contain corrosive and toxic materials. Handle carefully.
- **Unknown chemicals**: Industrial sites may have containers of acids, bases, solvents, or poisons. If you can't identify it, leave it.

### Electrical Hazards
- **Capacitors**: Large capacitors in electronics can hold lethal charges for years. Discharge before handling.
- **Batteries**: Even old batteries can cause shocks or shorts. Insulate terminals.

### Biological Hazards
- **Mold and fungus**: Wear masks in enclosed spaces.
- **Animal nests**: Rodents and insects carry disease. Be cautious.
- **Decomposition**: Avoid areas with remains. Disease risk.

### Radiation Hazards
- **Smoke detectors**: Contain americium-241. Small amounts but avoid breaking them.
- **Old gauges**: Some industrial and aircraft instruments use radium or tritium. If it glows in the dark, be very careful.
- **Medical equipment**: X-ray machines and some medical devices contain radioactive materials. Mark and avoid.
- **Industrial sources**: Nuclear density gauges, thickness sensors. Leave these alone unless you have radiation detection equipment.

**Always**: Work in teams. Establish emergency signals. Have first aid ready. Document hazardous locations and warn others.

## Priority Materials for Salvage

### Tier 1: Critical Materials (Salvage First)

**Copper Wire and Cable**

12. **Tires**: Rubber for various uses.

### Storage and Organization

Salvaged materials must be stored properly:

**Metals**:
- Sort by type: copper, aluminum, steel, stainless, brass, etc.
- Further sort by form: wire, sheet, structural, fasteners
- Storage: Keep dry to prevent corrosion. Oil steel to prevent rust.
- Label everything: "Copper Wire, 12-gauge, 15 kg, from 123 Main St."

**Electronics**:
- Anti-static: Store ICs and circuit boards in anti-static bags or wrap in aluminum foil
- Dry: Moisture causes corrosion
- Organized: Sort by type (capacitors, resistors, ICs, etc.)
- Documented: Note what device it came from if possible

**Glass**:
- Wrapped: Newspaper, cloth, or cardboard
- Separated: Don't let pieces touch
- Sorted: Laboratory glass separate from window glass
- Vertical storage: Less likely to break

**Chemicals and Batteries**:
- Ventilated: Fumes can build up
- Separate: Acids away from bases, flammables isolated
- Labeled: Clearly mark contents and hazards
- Contained: Double-contain anything that could leak
- Cool and dry: Extends shelf life

**Tools and Instruments**:
- Clean: Remove rust, oil moving parts
- Protected: Cases or wrapping to prevent damage
- Organized: Tool storage where items can be found quickly
- Maintained: Sharpen cutting tools, calibrate measuring instruments if possible

## Initial Salvage Priorities for a Starting Community

If you're just beginning, focus on this order:

**Week 1: Immediate Needs**
1. Hand tools (you need these to salvage everything else)
2. Containers (storage for salvage)
3. Solar panels and batteries (power for light and small tools)
4. Water containers and pipes
5. Wire and cable (copper)

**Month 1: Foundation Building**
1. More copper wire (hundreds of kg)
2. Steel and iron (structural materials)
3. Power tools (if you have electricity to run them)
4. Vehicles for transport (even if not running, can be repaired)
5. Machine tools (lathes, mills, drills)

**Year 1: Technology Base**
1. All electronic components you can find
2. Magnets, motors, and generators
3. Precision instruments and optics
4. Specialized materials (ceramics, refractories, insulation)
5. Chemical stockpiles (acids, bases, solvents)
6. Complete systems: computers, radios, test equipment

## Testing and Quality Control

Not all salvaged materials are usable:

**Metals**:
- Visual: Cracks, deep corrosion, or deformation may indicate weakness
- Magnet test: Distinguishes ferrous (magnetic) from non-ferrous metals
- Spark test: Different metals produce different sparks when ground (requires experience)
- File test: Hardness and texture indicate metal type
- Density: Weight vs. size can identify metals (gold is very heavy for its size)

**Electronics**:
- Visual: Look for burns, bulging capacitors, cracked components
- Multimeter: Test resistors, capacitors, diodes
- Power test: Carefully apply power to circuits, monitor for smoke or heat
- Note: Many components will still be good even if the device doesn't work

**Batteries**:
- Voltage test: Should be near rated voltage if good
- Load test: Connect to load, measure voltage drop
- Physical: Swelling, leaking, or damage means discard or recycle
- Lead-acid: Check electrolyte level and specific gravity if possible

**Wire and Cable**:
- Insulation: Cracked or brittle insulation should be stripped or replaced
- Conductor: Verify copper vs. aluminum (copper is more valuable)
- Corrosion: Green (copper) or white (aluminum) oxidation. Can be cleaned.

## Long-Term Salvage Consideration

**The salvage won't last forever.** Eventually, you'll have picked over the ruins. This is why manufacturing capability is critical. Use the initial salvage period (probably decades) to:

1. Build manufacturing capability while materials are available
2. Prioritize hard-to-make items (precision instruments, complex electronics)
3. Recycle and reuse everything possible
4. Establish mining and refining for post-salvage era

Think of salvage as a temporary advantage—a gift from the old world to help you rebuild. Use it wisely.
