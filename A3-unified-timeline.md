## Reading This Timeline

**Boxes** represent technology capabilities.
**Arrows** show dependencies (what must come before).
**Parallel tracks** show what can be developed simultaneously.
**Critical path** shows the longest dependency chain.

## Phase 0: Immediate Survival (Days 1-30)

**Focus**: Survival, triage, securing knowledge and resources.

| Week | Priority Tasks | References |
|------|---------------|------------|
| 1 | Water, shelter, food security | Ch -01 |
| 1 | Medical triage, establish safety | Ch -01, 12 |
| 1 | Form working groups | Ch -01 |
| 1-2 | Secure this book and other references | Ch -01 |
| 1-2 | Initial salvage: tools, medical, food | Ch -01, A1, A2 |

## Critical Path Analysis

The **critical path** is the longest chain of dependencies. Speeding up items not on the critical path doesn't speed up overall progress.

### Critical Path to Industrial Capability

```
Day 1: Survival
    ↓ (1 month)
Forge operational
    ↓ (6 months)
Basic tools
    ↓ (1 year)
Crude lathe
    ↓ (2 years)
Drill press + better lathe
    ↓ (2 years)
Precision lathe
    ↓ (3 years)
Milling machine
    ↓ (3 years)
Full machine shop
    ↓ (3 years)
Precision grinding
    ↓
Ball bearing manufacture
```

**Total Critical Path**: ~15 years from collapse to full machine shop capability.

### Critical Path to Electronics

```
[Full machine shop capability] (Year 15)
    ↓ (2 years)
Vacuum/furnace capability
    ↓ (2 years)
Silicon purification
    ↓ (3 years)
Semiconductor fab
    ↓ (3 years)
Integrated circuits
    ↓ (5 years)
Microprocessors
```

**Total Critical Path**: ~30+ years from collapse to microprocessor capability.

## Parallel Development Opportunities

These tracks can progress simultaneously, limited mainly by labor:

| Track 1 | Track 2 | Track 3 | Track 4 |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| Agriculture | Metalworking | Textiles | Chemistry |
| Food security | Tool making | Clothing | Materials |

| Track A | Track B | Track C |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Power (water/wind) | Electricity | Communications |
| Mechanical power | Generation | Signaling |

**Optimal Strategy**: Allocate labor to all tracks simultaneously. Don't neglect one for another—they're all necessary.

## Technology Dependency Matrix

This matrix shows which technologies must exist before others can begin.

| Technology | Dependencies |
|------------|--------------|

| Lathe | Forge, files, basic tools |
| Generator | Lathe, magnets, wire |
| Battery | Lead, sulfuric acid |
| Telegraph | Wire, battery |

## Bottleneck Technologies

Technologies that gate many others:

### 1. The Lathe (Year 2-5)

**Gates**: All precision manufacturing, engines, generators, vehicles, advanced electronics.

**Solution**: Prioritize lathe development. Accept crude first lathe. Iterate.

### 2. Precision Measurement (Year 5-10)

**Gates**: Interchangeable parts, precision machinery, scientific instruments.

**Solution**: Salvage all measuring tools. Develop standards early.

### 3. Electrical Generation (Year 3-8)

**Gates**: Electric motors, lighting, communications, electronics.

**Solution**: Parallel path—simple generators early, improve over time.

### 4. Fuel Production (Year 5-15)

**Gates**: Internal combustion, mobility, chemistry.

**Solution**: Multiple fuel paths (wood gas, biodiesel, petroleum).

### 5. Semiconductor Capability (Year 20-30+)

**Gates**: Modern electronics, computing, communications.

**Solution**: Very long-term goal. Focus on vacuum tube intermediates.

## Community Size vs. Timeline

Larger communities can parallelize more work:

| Community Size | Expected Timeline | Notes |
|----------------|-------------------|-------|
| 20-50 people | 1.5× longer | Limited specialization |
| 100-200 people | Baseline | Can support specialists |
| 500-1000 people | 0.75× baseline | Full specialization possible |
| 1000+ people | 0.5-0.75× baseline | Division of labor |

**Minimum Viable Community**: ~100 people for full parallel development. Smaller groups must prioritize carefully.

---

## Regional Variation

### Temperate Climate (Baseline)

Standard timelines as shown.

### Tropical Climate

- **Agriculture**: Faster (longer growing season)
- **Natural rubber**: Available (Year 3-5 instead of never)
- **Energy**: May rely more on biomass
- **Challenges**: Disease, material decay

**Overall**: Similar or faster timeline.

### Arid Climate

- **Water**: Critical constraint
- **Agriculture**: Irrigation required from start
- **Solar potential**: High
- **Challenges**: Food and water security

**Overall**: Slower initially, then comparable.

### Cold Climate

- **Agriculture**: Shorter season, greenhouse needed
- **Energy**: Higher heating needs
- **Materials**: Some decay slower
- **Challenges**: Survival energy needs

**Overall**: Significantly slower (~1.5× timeline).

### Coastal vs. Inland

| Factor | Coastal | Inland |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Salt | Easy | Must trade |
| Fish | Abundant | Rare |
| Transport | Sea access | Land only |
| Materials | Some salvage | Different salvage |

**The honest truth**: Rebuilding takes decades, not years. There are no shortcuts. But humanity built this technology once, starting from stone tools. We can do it again—faster, because we know where we're going.

The timeline is long. The path is clear. Start now.
