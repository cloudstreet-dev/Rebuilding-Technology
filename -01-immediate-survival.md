# Chapter -1: Immediate Survival (Years 0-2)

## Critical Priority Warning

**Stop. Read this chapter first.**

If you're reading this in the aftermath of a collapse, your first priority is not electronics or computing. Your first priority is staying alive long enough to rebuild. This chapter covers the absolute basics that must be established before any technological work can begin.

Without these systems, your community will not survive to see Chapter 1.

## Timeline Reality

- **Week 1-4**: Immediate survival (water, food, shelter, security)
- **Month 1-6**: Establish basic sanitation and disease prevention
- **Year 1**: Stabilize food production, establish governance
- **Year 2**: Begin specialization and knowledge preservation

Only after these foundations are solid should you even think about metallurgy or electricity.

## 1. Water: The First Priority

Humans die in 3 days without water. Contaminated water kills through dysentery, cholera, typhoid.

### Immediate Water Sources (Day 1-7)

**Bottled Water Salvage**
- Priority salvage target in first week
- Sealed bottles safe for years if stored properly
- Check for contamination (cloudiness, smell, taste)
- Store in cool, dark location

**Natural Sources Assessment**
- Running water safer than stagnant
- Spring water generally safer than river water
- Avoid water downstream of cities (chemical contamination)
- Never trust water safety without treatment

### Water Purification Methods

#### Boiling (Most Reliable)

**Procedure:**
1. Bring water to rolling boil
2. Boil for 1 minute at sea level
3. Add 1 minute per 1000 feet elevation above sea level
4. Cool and store in clean containers

**Advantages:**
- Kills all biological pathogens (bacteria, viruses, parasites)
- No special materials needed
- Reliable

**Disadvantages:**
- Fuel intensive
- Doesn't remove chemical contamination
- Doesn't remove particulates

#### Sand Filtration (Low-Tech, Effective)

**Build a Slow Sand Filter:**

Materials:
- Large barrel or drum (55-gallon drum ideal)
- Gravel (3-6 inches, washed)
- Coarse sand (6 inches, washed)
- Fine sand (18-24 inches, washed)
- Spigot or tap near bottom
- Cloth or screen at top

Construction:
1. Drill hole near bottom for spigot
2. Layer from bottom up:
   - 6 inches coarse gravel
   - 6 inches medium gravel
   - 6 inches coarse sand
   - 18-24 inches fine sand
3. Place cloth/screen on top to prevent disturbance
4. Pour water slowly on top
5. Collect from spigot

**How It Works:**
- Biological layer forms on sand surface in 1-4 weeks
- Bacteria consume pathogens
- Sand physically filters particles
- Flow rate: 0.1-0.3 meters per hour

**Maintenance:**
- When flow slows, scrape top 1-2 cm of sand
- Replace scraped sand periodically
- Never let filter dry out (kills biological layer)

**Effectiveness:**
- Removes 99%+ of bacteria and parasites
- Removes some viruses
- **Still boil output water in first year** until you're confident

#### Solar Distillation (Fuel-Free)

**Simple Solar Still:**

Materials:
- Clear plastic sheet or glass pane
- Container for dirty water
- Collection container
- Weight (rock)

Construction:
1. Dig shallow pit
2. Place dirty water container in center
3. Place collection container in center (elevated)
4. Cover pit with clear plastic
5. Seal edges with dirt
6. Place small weight in center so plastic slopes to collection point

**Output:**
- 1-2 liters per square meter per day (sunny climate)
- Pure distilled water
- Slow but requires no fuel

**Use Case:**
- Emergency backup
- Coastal areas (can distill seawater)
- When fuel is scarce

#### Chemical Treatment

**Chlorine (Bleach):**
- Use unscented household bleach (5-6% sodium hypochlorite)
- 2 drops per liter of clear water
- 4 drops per liter of cloudy water
- Wait 30 minutes before drinking
- Water should have slight chlorine smell (if not, repeat and wait 15 more minutes)

**Shelf Life:**
- Bleach loses potency over time
- Replace yearly
- Store in cool, dark place

**Iodine:**
- 5 drops 2% tincture of iodine per liter
- Wait 30 minutes
- Not safe for pregnant women or people with thyroid issues

### Water Storage

**Clean Containers:**
- Food-grade plastic (salvage: soda bottles, water jugs)
- Glass (can be boiled to sterilize)
- Ceramic (glazed, no cracks)

**Sanitization:**
1. Wash with hot soapy water
2. Rinse thoroughly
3. Sanitize with bleach solution (1 tsp per quart, rinse)
4. Air dry

**Long-Term Storage:**
- Rotate stored water every 6 months
- Store in cool, dark location
- Label with date

## 2. Food: Staying Alive While You Rebuild

### Immediate Food Sources (Week 1-12)

**Salvage Priority List:**
1. Canned goods (years of shelf life)
2. Dried goods (rice, beans, pasta, flour)
3. Freeze-dried foods
4. Dried fruits and nuts
5. Sugar and salt (preserve other foods)
6. Cooking oil

**Shelf Life Reality:**
- Canned goods: 2-5 years (often safe much longer if can is intact)
- Dried beans/rice: Indefinite if kept dry and pest-free
- Flour: 6-12 months (longer if frozen)
- Honey: Indefinite

**Safety Inspection:**
- Reject bulging, rusted, or damaged cans
- Check for off smells when opened
- Boil questionable food before eating

### Food Preservation Techniques

#### Drying (Oldest, Most Reliable)

**Sun Drying:**
- Best for: Fruits, vegetables, herbs, fish, meat (in strips)
- Cut food into thin, uniform pieces
- Place on clean, dry surface (screens, racks)
- Cover with cloth to prevent flies
- Turn daily
- Dry until brittle or leathery (no moisture when bent)
- Store in airtight containers

**Testing Dryness:**
- Fruits: Leathery, no moisture when squeezed
- Vegetables: Brittle, crumble when crushed
- Meat: Hard, dark, cracks when bent

**Fire/Smoke Drying:**
- Build low fire (not too hot)
- Hang food above on racks
- Keep smoke going (prevents flies, adds antimicrobial compounds)
- Drying time: 1-3 days depending on thickness

#### Salting

**Dry Salting (for meat and fish):**
1. Cut meat into strips or leave fish whole (gutted)
2. Cover completely in salt (3:1 salt to meat ratio by weight)
3. Place in container with drainage
4. Reapply salt every few days as it draws moisture
5. After 1-2 weeks, brush off excess salt
6. Hang to air-dry in cool, dry place
7. Store in cool, dry location

**Brine Curing:**
1. Make brine: 1 pound salt per gallon water
2. Submerge meat/fish completely
3. Weight down to keep submerged
4. Keep in cool place
5. Meat preserved for months

**Salt Sources:**
- Salvage table salt (iodized is fine)
- Sea water evaporation (coastal areas)
- Rock salt deposits

#### Smoking

**Build a Simple Smokehouse:**

Materials:
- Barrel or wooden box (3-4 feet tall)
- Racks or poles to hang meat
- Fire pit below
- Vents (controllable)

Procedure:
1. Salt meat first (dry salt or brine)
2. Hang in smokehouse
3. Build small fire below (hardwood only—no pine/resinous wood)
4. Keep smoke going continuously
5. Maintain temperature 90-120°F (warm, not hot)
6. Smoke for 1-3 days minimum

**Wood Choice:**
- Good: Oak, hickory, apple, cherry, maple
- Bad: Pine, cedar, fir (toxic resins)

**Preservation Power:**
- Smoke contains antimicrobial compounds
- Drying effect preserves
- Combination of salt + smoke = months of preservation

#### Fermentation

**Sauerkraut (Simple Lacto-Fermentation):**

1. Shred cabbage finely
2. Add 2-3% salt by weight (about 3 tablespoons per 5 pounds cabbage)
3. Massage salt into cabbage (breaks cell walls, releases water)
4. Pack tightly into jar or crock
5. Ensure cabbage is submerged in its own brine (add salted water if needed)
6. Cover with cloth (allows gas out, keeps flies out)
7. Wait 1-4 weeks at room temperature
8. Store in cool place (cellar)

**Why It Works:**
- Salt inhibits bad bacteria
- Lactobacillus bacteria (naturally present) ferment sugars
- Acid produced preserves food
- Results in safe, nutritious food that lasts months

**Other Fermented Foods:**
- Pickles (cucumbers in brine)
- Kimchi (spicy fermented vegetables)
- Yogurt (if you have milk)
- Sourdough (fermented bread)

#### Root Cellars (Long-Term Storage)

**Location:**
- Underground or partially underground
- North side of hill (cooler)
- Good drainage (never floods)

**Construction:**
- Dig into hillside or excavate pit
- Walls: Stone, wood, or earth
- Insulation: Earth covering (2+ feet)
- Ventilation: Two pipes (high and low for air circulation)
- Door: Thick, insulated

**Ideal Conditions:**
- Temperature: 32-40°F (0-5°C)
- Humidity: 85-95%
- Darkness

**Storage Life (in good root cellar):**
- Potatoes: 5-8 months
- Carrots, beets: 4-6 months
- Cabbage: 3-4 months
- Apples: 2-6 months (variety dependent)
- Onions, garlic: 5-8 months (hang in dry area)

**Storage Tips:**
- Never store apples with potatoes (apples release ethylene gas, sprouts potatoes)
- Remove any damaged produce immediately (spreads rot)
- Check stored food weekly

---

## 3. Sanitation and Disease Prevention

**Dysentery, cholera, and typhoid have killed more people than violence in most collapses. Sanitation is not optional.**

### Human Waste Management

**Never:**
- Defecate near water sources (minimum 200 feet away, downhill from water)
- Leave waste exposed (attracts flies, spreads disease)
- Use "night soil" (human waste) on food crops without composting 1+ year

#### Latrine Construction

**Simple Pit Latrine:**

Location:
- 50+ feet from living areas
- 200+ feet from water sources
- Downhill from water sources
- Above water table

Construction:
1. Dig pit 3-6 feet deep, 2-3 feet wide
2. Mound dirt around edge (prevents rain runoff entering)
3. Build seat/platform over pit (wood or stone)
4. Build shelter for privacy and rain protection
5. Provide cover for hole when not in use (board, lid)
6. Keep ash or lime nearby to add after each use (reduces smell, kills pathogens)

Maintenance:
- Add ash or lime after each use
- When pit is 2/3 full, fill with dirt and dig new pit
- Mark old pit and avoid for 1-2 years

**Improved Latrine (Ventilated):**
- Add 4-6 inch vent pipe from pit to above roof level
- Paint pipe black (heats in sun, creates updraft)
- Updraft removes smell and draws flies into pipe (they die trying to reach light)

#### Composting Toilets (Advanced)

**Twin-Vault System:**
1. Build two sealed chambers side by side
2. Use one until full (6 months - 1 year)
3. Switch to second chamber
4. First chamber composts while second fills
5. After 1-2 years, first chamber's compost is safe
6. Remove composted material, use on non-food crops or trees
7. Repeat cycle

**Why It Works:**
- Time kills pathogens
- Heat from composting accelerates
- Mature compost is safe

### Keeping Clean

**Soap Making (Critical Skill):**

Materials:
- Fat/oil (animal fat, vegetable oil)
- Lye (see below)
- Water

Lye Production (from wood ash):
1. Collect hardwood ash (soft wood doesn't work well)
2. Put ash in barrel with small hole near bottom
3. Add water, let drain through
4. Liquid that drains out is lye water
5. Test strength: Float an egg (if egg floats with quarter-sized area showing, lye is ready)

Cold Process Soap:
1. **Safety**: Lye is caustic. Wear eye protection. Work outdoors or in ventilated area.
2. Measure lye water and oil (traditional ratio: 1 part lye water to 3 parts fat by volume)
3. Heat fat to 95-100°F
4. Slowly add lye water to fat (never the reverse!)
5. Stir constantly until mixture "traces" (leaves pattern when dripped on surface)
6. Pour into molds
7. Let set 24-48 hours
8. Cut into bars
9. Cure for 4-6 weeks (soap gets milder as it ages)

**Why Soap Matters:**
- Handwashing prevents most disease transmission
- Clean wounds prevent infection
- Clean cooking surfaces prevent food poisoning

**When to Wash Hands:**
- Before preparing food
- Before eating
- After using latrine
- After handling animals
- After treating wounds

### Disease Prevention

**Fly Control (Major Disease Vector):**
- Cover all food
- Manage waste properly (latrines, covered compost)
- Eliminate standing water (mosquito breeding)
- Screen windows and doors if possible

**Rodent Control:**
- Store food in sealed containers (metal, thick plastic, glass)
- Keep sleeping areas clean
- Eliminate hiding places near dwellings
- Trap or poison if necessary

**Water Treatment:**
- See Section 1 (boil all water if any doubt)

**Food Safety:**
- Cook meat thoroughly
- Wash vegetables in clean water
- Keep hot food hot (above 140°F) or cold food cold (below 40°F)
- Discard food left at room temperature 2+ hours

## 4. Shelter Construction

You can't operate a forge in the rain. You can't build vacuum tubes without a stable workspace. Shelter comes first.

### Salvaged Structures

**Assessment Checklist:**
- Roof intact (most important)
- Walls structurally sound
- Floor dry (not flood-prone)
- Windows/doors present or repairable
- No major fire damage (structural weakness)

**Repair Priorities:**
1. Roof (keeps everything dry)
2. Walls (security, insulation)
3. Windows/doors (security, temperature control)
4. Floor (can work on dirt floor if necessary)

### Building from Scratch

**Site Selection:**
- High ground (won't flood)
- Near water source (but not too near)
- Flat or gently sloped
- Drainage away from building site
- Access to materials

#### Simple Timber Frame Shelter

Materials:
- Logs or large timbers (salvaged lumber ideal)
- Tools: Saw, axe, hammer, nails or rope
- Roofing material (see below)

Construction:
1. Mark corners (rectangular, 10x12 feet for small shelter)
2. Dig post holes at corners (2-3 feet deep)
3. Set corner posts (8-10 feet tall)
4. Connect with horizontal beams
5. Add roof rafters (sloped for rain drainage)
6. Build walls (vertical boards, horizontal logs, etc.)
7. Add roof covering

**Roof Options (in order of durability):**
1. Salvaged metal roofing (best, but limited)
2. Salvaged asphalt shingles
3. Wooden shingles/shakes (cut from logs)
4. Thatch (grass, reeds, straw) - requires steep pitch, good drainage
5. Bark sheets (temporary)

**Critical: Roof Pitch**
- Minimum 4:12 slope (4 inches rise per 12 inches run)
- Steeper is better for rain/snow
- Thatch requires 45-50 degree pitch minimum

#### Adobe/Mud Brick (Arid Climates)

Materials:
- Clay soil
- Sand
- Straw or grass (binder)
- Water
- Wooden molds

Adobe Recipe:
- 3 parts sand
- 1 part clay
- Straw (handful per 10 bricks)
- Water to workable consistency

Process:
1. Mix ingredients thoroughly
2. Pack into wooden molds (10x14x4 inches typical)
3. Smooth top
4. Remove from mold
5. Dry in sun 1-2 weeks (turn halfway through)
6. Stack when fully dry

Building:
- Lay bricks with mud mortar
- Walls 2 bricks thick for strength
- Plaster exterior with mud (protects from rain)
- Roof must overhang to protect walls

### Insulation

**Why It Matters:**
- Reduces fuel needs (critical in winter)
- Makes workspace comfortable (better productivity)
- Prevents moisture/mold

**Materials (Best to Worst):**
1. Salvaged fiberglass insulation (if intact and dry)
2. Straw bales (in walls)
3. Packed dry grass or leaves
4. Mud/clay with straw mixed in
5. Air gaps (double walls)

---

## 5. Security and Governance

**You cannot rebuild technology alone. You need a stable community. Stable communities require security and fair governance.**

### Physical Security Basics

**Site Selection:**
- Defensible position (avoid low ground, dead-end valleys)
- Multiple escape routes
- Visibility of approaches

**Perimeter:**
- Fence or wall (even simple wire fence provides warning/delay)
- Clear sight lines (remove brush near perimeter)
- Alarm systems (bells, tripwires with noisemakers)

**Storage Security:**
- Lock critical supplies (tools, weapons, medicine, food stores)
- Distribute knowledge (no single point of failure)
- Guard valuable salvage (copper, electronics, tools)

### Social Organization

**Why This Matters:**
- Specialization is impossible without security
- Knowledge transfer requires teaching (social stability)
- Large projects need cooperation

**Essential Roles (Even in Small Communities):**
- Leadership/decision-making
- Security/watch
- Food production
- Water management
- Medicine/health
- Education/knowledge preservation

**Governance Principles:**
- Clear, written rules
- Transparent decision-making
- Dispute resolution process
- Resource allocation fairness
- Contribution expectations

**Knowledge Preservation:**
- Protect this guide and all books
- Teach literacy immediately (critical!)
- Apprenticeship system (pass skills down)
- Document successes and failures

### Knowledge Triage: The Uncomfortable Truth About Specialists

**If someone in your community has pre-collapse specialized knowledge, their brain is more valuable than their hands.**

This creates uncomfortable social dynamics that must be explicitly acknowledged and managed.

**Priority Knowledge Carriers:**
- Doctors, nurses, EMTs (medical knowledge)
- Chemists, pharmacists (chemistry, drug production)
- Engineers (mechanical, electrical, chemical, civil)
- Machinists and skilled tradespeople (practical manufacturing)
- Teachers (knowledge transfer)
- Farmers (especially experienced ones)
- Electricians and electronics technicians

**The Social Problem:**

In immediate survival, everyone must contribute labor. Food doesn't grow itself. Water doesn't purify itself. But if your doctor is spending 12 hours a day hauling water and planting potatoes, when do they:
- Teach others medicine?
- Document their knowledge?
- Practice surgery when someone needs it?

**The Uncomfortable Decision:**

**Specialists should be assigned to knowledge transfer, not just manual labor.** This means:
- Doctor spends 4 hours/day documenting medical knowledge
- Chemist spends time teaching chemistry basics, writing procedures
- Engineer documents machine designs and repair techniques
- Farmer teaches crop management (not just working fields alone)

**This will feel unfair to others who are exhausted from manual labor.** That's why it must be:
1. **Explained explicitly**: "We're not saving them from work. We're saving their knowledge from being lost."
2. **Written into community rules**: Not favoritism, it's policy
3. **Visible**: Others should see them teaching, writing, documenting
4. **Limited duration**: Once knowledge is transferred and documented, they return to normal labor split

**Specific Actions (Week 1-2):**

1. **Identify knowledge carriers**
   - Ask: "What was your job before?"
   - Ask: "What specialized knowledge do you have?"
   - Don't assume (the quiet person in the corner might be a chemist)

2. **Assign documentation tasks immediately**
   - Give them paper and writing materials (salvage priority!)
   - Specific assignment: "Write down everything you know about X"
   - Set deadline: Within 3 months, documentation must exist

3. **Assign apprentices**
   - Every specialist gets 1-3 apprentices
   - Apprentices split time: Labor + learning
   - Goal: Transfer critical knowledge before specialist dies/is injured

4. **Protect specialists from high-risk work**
   - Your only surgeon should not be on the most dangerous salvage missions
   - Your only chemist should not be doing high-risk construction
   - This is NOT coddling, this is risk management
   - If they die, their knowledge dies with them

**The Death Scenario (Plan for It):**

Specialists will die. Accidents, disease, age. You must plan for this:
- Written documentation (see Chapter 0.7 on Libraries)
- At least 2 people trained in critical skills (redundancy)
- Succession planning (who learns from the apprentices?)
- Regular knowledge tests (verify apprentices actually learned it)

**Social Friction Management:**

**Problem**: "Why does the doctor only work 6 hours while I work 12?"

**Answer (Have This Ready):**
"The doctor works 6 hours hauling water and 6 hours teaching three apprentices how to deliver babies and treat infections. When you're dying of dysentery, you'll be glad we did this. Their knowledge helps everyone survive. Once all three apprentices can deliver a baby safely, the doctor goes back to 12-hour days like everyone else."

**Be Explicit About Timeline:**
- First 6 months: Heavy knowledge transfer (reduced manual labor)
- Months 6-18: Moderate (teaching + normal labor)
- After 18 months: Full labor participation once knowledge is transferred

**Failure Mode (What Happens If You Don't Do This):**

Year 0: Doctor works 12 hours/day farming. No time to teach.
Year 1: Doctor dies from dysentery (ironic but common in collapses).
Year 2: Woman has complicated childbirth. No one knows what to do. Mother and baby die.
Year 3: Infection spreads. No one knows how to make antibiotics. Six people die.
Year 5: Community knows farming but has lost all medical knowledge. Preventable deaths are common.

**Success Mode (What Happens If You Do This Right):**

Year 0: Doctor works 6 hours farming, 6 hours teaching three apprentices. Community grumbles but accepts it.
Year 1: Doctor dies from dysentery. Community grieves but has three trained apprentices.
Year 2: Apprentice successfully delivers complicated baby. Mother and baby live.
Year 3: Apprentice uses documented procedures to make crude penicillin. Infection treated. Patient lives.
Year 5: Community has basic medical knowledge preserved. Preventable death rate dropping.
Year 10: Original apprentices are now teaching their own students. Medical knowledge is stable.

**Other Critical Knowledge to Extract:**

If someone knows these, get it documented immediately:
- **Penicillin production** (see Chapter 3.5)
- **Electronics repair** (salvaged equipment will break)
- **Welding and metalworking** (critical for everything)
- **Water system design** (wells, purification, distribution)
- **Electrical systems** (generators, wiring, safety)
- **Concrete and construction** (structural failures kill)
- **Canning and food preservation** (beyond what's in this guide)
- **Veterinary medicine** (draft animals will get sick)
- **Mechanical repair** (keeping machines running)

**The Documentation Priority List:**

**Week 1-4 (Immediate):**
- Medical procedures (emergency treatment, childbirth, basic surgery)
- Water purification (beyond what's in this chapter)
- Food safety and preservation
- Sanitation and disease prevention

**Month 2-6 (Soon):**
- Metallurgy and welding
- Electrical systems
- Mechanical repair
- Chemistry basics
- Construction techniques

**Month 6-24 (Important):**
- Advanced electronics
- Computer systems (before knowledge fades)
- Specialized manufacturing
- Scientific procedures

**Format for Documentation:**

**Not This**: "Obviously you need to maintain sterile conditions during surgery."

**This**:
"Sterilize instruments by boiling in water for 15 minutes minimum. Surgeon scrubs hands for 5 minutes with soap. Use cleanest available cloth for draping. Infection kills more patients than the surgery itself. If instruments touch anything non-sterile, re-boil them."

**Specific. Procedural. Assumes reader knows nothing.**

**Knowledge Carrier Self-Documentation:**

If YOU are a specialist, start writing NOW:
1. Get paper and pen (salvage immediately)
2. Write everything you know
3. Assume your reader knows nothing
4. Include measurements, temperatures, times, procedures
5. Draw diagrams
6. Note safety warnings
7. List common mistakes
8. Date and sign your work

**Your knowledge will outlive you. Make it count.**

---

## 7. When to Move to Chapter 1

**Don't rush. These indicators must be met:**

✓ Zero deaths from dysentery/waterborne disease in past 3 months
✓ Food surplus (not just subsistence)
✓ Shelter stable and weatherproof
✓ Community governance functional
✓ Security threats managed
✓ Education system in place
✓ People have TIME to specialize (not 100% subsistence)

**If any indicator is not met, do not proceed to metallurgy or electricity. Fix the foundations first.**

---

## 8. Critical Mindsets

### Don't Die of Dysentery

This sounds trivial but most people in collapses die of preventable disease, not violence. Water purification, sanitation, and hygiene are more important than any technology.

### Slow and Steady

Civilization took 10,000 years the first time. You're not going to rebuild it in a year. Focus on stability, not speed.

### Document Everything

- Keep daily logs
- Record failures (especially important!)
- Write down modifications to these procedures
- Teach others to write

### Think Generationally

The people who establish clean water and stable food might not live to see computers. That's okay. You're building foundations for your children's children.

## 9. Common Fatal Mistakes

**Mistake 1: Neglecting Sanitation**
- Result: Cholera, dysentery, typhoid epidemics
- Prevention: Proper latrines, handwashing, water purification

**Mistake 2: Insufficient Food Preservation**
- Result: Starvation in winter or off-season
- Prevention: Multiple preservation methods, root cellar, grain storage

**Mistake 3: Poor Water Management**
- Result: Dehydration or waterborne disease
- Prevention: Multiple sources, purification always, storage capacity

**Mistake 4: Weak Governance**
- Result: Social collapse, violence, inability to coordinate
- Prevention: Early establishment of fair rules, dispute resolution

**Mistake 5: Not Teaching**
- Result: Knowledge dies with current generation
- Prevention: Formal education, apprenticeships, written documentation

---

## 10. Safety and Health Basics

### Common Injuries and Prevention

**Cuts and Wounds:**
- Clean immediately with boiled water
- Apply pressure to stop bleeding
- Cover with clean cloth
- Change dressing daily
- Watch for infection (redness, swelling, heat, pus)

**Burns:**
- Cool with clean water (not ice)
- Cover with clean, dry dressing
- Do not pop blisters
- Severe burns (large area, deep) are life-threatening

**Broken Bones:**
- Immobilize above and below break
- Splint with rigid material (wood, metal)
- Do not try to set compound fractures (bone through skin)
- Immobilize and seek most skilled person available

**Infection Signs:**
- Redness spreading from wound
- Warmth at site
- Swelling
- Pus
- Red streaks up limb (blood poisoning - urgent)
- Fever

### Basic Herbal Medicine (Until Chapter on Medicine)

**Willow Bark (Pain, Fever):**
- Contains salicin (aspirin precursor)
- Boil bark in water, drink tea
- Dose: 1-2 cups daily

**Yarrow (Bleeding):**
- Crush fresh leaves, apply to wound
- Helps clotting

**Plantain (Common Weed):**
- Crush leaves, apply to insect bites, minor wounds
- Anti-inflammatory

**Garlic (Antimicrobial):**
- Eat raw (1-2 cloves daily)
- Antimicrobial properties
- Helps prevent infection

**Warning:** These are not substitutes for modern medicine, but better than nothing. See Medicine chapter for producing actual antibiotics.

## Conclusion: Survival Before Technology

Every chapter after this one assumes you have successfully established these systems. There is no point in building a radio if your community is dying of cholera. There is no point in learning metallurgy if you don't have time because you're hunting for every meal.

**The hierarchy is:**
1. Water
2. Food
3. Shelter
4. Sanitation
5. Security
6. Governance
7. Specialization (only now can you think about technology)

Spend Year 1 on survival. Spend Year 2 on stability. Only in Year 3+ should you seriously attempt the technologies in the following chapters.

**This is not exciting. It is not glamorous. But it is survival.**

Once you have achieved stable survival—when you have time and resources to dedicate people to specialized work—then and only then should you proceed to Chapter 1: Salvaging the Old World.

Until then, stay alive. Teach your children to read. Document everything. Preserve this guide.

The technology will wait. Dead people cannot rebuild anything.

---

**Next Chapter: [Chapter 1: Salvaging the Old World](01-salvaging-the-old-world.md)**

*Only proceed when survival systems are stable and you have surplus labor for specialization.*
