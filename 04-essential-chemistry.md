# Chapter 4: Essential Chemistry

## Why Chemistry Matters for Technology

Chemistry provides the materials that make technology possible:
- **Acids and bases**: Batteries, etching, cleaning, electroplating
- **Solvents**: Cleaning electronics, dissolving materials
- **Plastics and polymers**: Insulation, structural materials, coatings
- **Glass**: Optics, containers, vacuum tubes, displays
- **Semiconductors**: The foundation of all modern electronics
- **Metals refining**: Purifying materials
- **Explosives**: Mining, construction (use carefully!)

Without chemistry, you're limited to mechanical devices. With chemistry, you can create almost any material you need.

## Safety First: Chemical Hazards

**Acids and Bases**:
- Cause severe chemical burns
- Vapors can damage lungs
- Splashes can blind
- Always wear: Goggles, gloves, protective clothing
- Add acid to water, NEVER water to acid (causes explosive boiling)
- Have neutralizers ready: Baking soda for acids, vinegar for bases

**Flammable Solvents**:
- Vapors can ignite from sparks, flames, hot surfaces
- Heavier-than-air vapors travel across floors to ignition sources
- Use in well-ventilated areas
- No sparks or flames
- Fire extinguisher nearby

**Toxic Substances**:
- Many chemicals are poisonous
- Some (mercury, lead, cadmium) accumulate in body
- Fumes from heating metals can kill (zinc, cadmium)
- Always work with ventilation
- Wash hands thoroughly
- Never eat, drink, or smoke in work area

**Reactive and Explosive**:
- Some chemicals react violently (acids + bases, oxidizers + fuels)
- Keep incompatible chemicals separate
- Label everything
- Store in cool, dry place

## Basic Equipment

### Glassware

**Essential Pieces** (salvage from labs, schools, hospitals):
- **Beakers**: Mixing, heating, measuring
- **Flasks**:
  - Erlenmeyer: Mixing, can be stoppered
  - Round-bottom: Distillation, heating
  - Florence: Storage, heating
- **Test tubes**: Small-scale testing
- **Graduated cylinders**: Precise volume measurement
- **Funnels**: Transferring liquids, filtration
- **Condensers**: Cooling vapors back to liquid (distillation)
- **Stirring rods**: Glass or ceramic

**Make Your Own** (if necessary):
- Bottles and jars: Glass containers from salvage
- Tubes: From broken glassware or light bulbs
- Glassworking: Heat glass to 800°C+, can bend and join
  - Requires practice and proper torch
  - Borosilicate (Pyrex) is harder to work than soda-lime glass

### Heat Sources

- **Alcohol burner**: Simple, controllable, up to 400°C
- **Bunsen burner**: Propane or natural gas, up to 1,000°C+
- **Hot plate**: Electric, even heat, safe indoors
- **Sand bath**: Pot of sand on heat source, very even heating for glassware
- **Oil bath**: Pot of oil, precise temperature control up to ~300°C

### Filtration

- **Filter paper**: Salvage coffee filters or use cloth
- **Buchner funnel**: Vacuum filtration (much faster)
  - Needs vacuum pump or aspirator

### Distillation

**Purpose**: Separate liquids by boiling point, purify chemicals

**Setup**:
```
Heat source → Flask (liquid to distill) → Condenser (cools vapor) → Collection flask
```

**Process**:
1. Heat liquid in flask
2. Component with lowest boiling point vaporizes first
3. Vapor travels to condenser
4. Cold water flowing through condenser cools vapor back to liquid
5. Pure liquid drips into collection flask
6. Different boiling points separate components

**Uses**:
- Purifying water
- Making alcohol (ethanol)
- Separating solvents
- Refining chemicals

### Measuring and Testing

**pH Paper/Indicators**:
- Test acidity/alkalinity
- pH 0-6: Acid
- pH 7: Neutral
- pH 8-14: Base/Alkaline
- Make your own from red cabbage (turns pink in acid, blue in base)

**Balance/Scale**:
- Essential for measuring chemicals
- Precision: 0.1g adequate for most work, 0.01g better
- Salvage digital scales or build beam balance

**Thermometer**:
- Monitor reaction temperatures
- Critical for distillation
- Mercury thermometers (be careful—toxic if broken)
- Alcohol thermometers (safer)
- Thermocouple (electric, more precise)

### High-Temperature Measurement (For Glass, Metals, Ceramics)

Standard thermometers fail above ~500°C. For glass making (1,400°C), metal smelting (1,500°C+), and silicon production (1,900°C), alternative methods are essential.

**Color-Temperature Correlation** (Black Body Radiation):

Heated metals and materials glow with characteristic colors. With practice, this provides rough temperature estimates:

- **525°C (977°F)**: Faint red glow (barely visible in darkness)
- **700°C (1,292°F)**: Dull red (visible in dim light)
- **900°C (1,652°F)**: Cherry red
- **1,100°C (2,012°F)**: Bright cherry red
- **1,200°C (2,192°F)**: Orange
- **1,300°C (2,372°F)**: Yellow-orange
- **1,400°C (2,552°F)**: Yellow-white (glass working temperature)
- **1,500°C+ (2,732°F+)**: White (steel melting, bright white)

**Limitations**: Color depends on lighting conditions, eye sensitivity, material surface. Experienced smelters develop good intuition but it's imprecise (±50-100°C).

**Pyrometric Cones** (Seger Cones):

Small ceramic pyramids formulated to deform/bend/melt at specific temperatures.

**How they work**:
- Place cone next to work piece in furnace
- As temperature rises, cone softens and bends
- When cone tip touches base, target temperature reached
- Different formulations for different temperatures (600°C to 2,000°C range)

**Make your own** (requires testing/calibration):
- Mix clay with varying amounts of flux (feldspar, limestone, borax)
- More flux = lower melting point
- Form into small pyramids (~1 inch tall)
- Fire test batches at known temperatures (if you have thermocouple)
- Note which compositions bend at which temperatures
- Standardize formulas for reproducibility

**Commercial cones** (if salvageable):
- Ceramic suppliers
- Pottery studios
- Labeled with numbers (Orton cone 04, 06, etc.)
- Each number corresponds to specific temperature

**Advantages**:
- Visual indication inside furnace (no instruments needed)
- Accurate for ceramics and glass (measures heat work, not just temperature)
- Reliable, reusable concept (make new cones as needed)

**Thermocouple** (Electrical Temperature Sensor):

Two dissimilar metal wires joined at tip. Temperature difference between tip (hot) and other end (cold) generates small voltage. Measure voltage → know temperature.

**Types** (by metal pair):
- **Type K** (Chromel-Alumel): -200°C to +1,350°C, most common, general purpose
- **Type J** (Iron-Constantan): 0°C to +750°C, older standard
- **Type S** (Platinum-Rhodium): 0°C to +1,750°C, expensive, very accurate, used for glass/metal work

**Construction** (if you can obtain wire):
1. Get two different metal wires (e.g., iron and constantan, or chromel and alumel)
2. Twist ends together tightly
3. Weld or braze junction (for durability)
4. Insulate wires from each other except at junction
5. Connect other ends to voltmeter (millivolt range)
6. Calibrate:
   - Ice water bath: 0°C (reference point)
   - Boiling water: 100°C
   - Known melting points (lead 327°C, zinc 420°C, aluminum 660°C)
   - Plot voltage vs. temperature
   - Use lookup table or formula

**Advantages**:
- Precise (±1-2°C possible)
- Fast response
- Wide temperature range
- Can read remotely (wire extends out of furnace)

**Disadvantages**:
- Requires specific metal wire pairs (hard to source post-collapse)
- Requires voltmeter (electronics)
- Thermocouple wire degrades at high temperature (limited lifetime)

**Optical Pyrometer** (Advanced, Tier 2-3):

Compares color of glowing object to calibrated filament. Adjust filament brightness until it matches object glow. Read temperature from calibration.

**Concept**:
- Look through eyepiece at glowing furnace
- See calibrated lamp filament superimposed on view
- Adjust current through lamp until filament disappears (same brightness as target)
- Read temperature from ammeter/calibration

**Construction**: Complex, requires precision optics and calibrated lamp. Not recommended for early reconstruction, but possible for later stages.

**Melting Point Standards** (Calibration References):

Use known melting points to calibrate instruments or judge furnace temperatures:

| Material | Melting Point |
|----------|---------------|
| Ice / Water | 0°C (32°F) |
| Tin | 232°C (450°F) |
| Lead | 327°C (621°F) |
| Zinc | 420°C (787°F) |
| Aluminum | 660°C (1,221°F) |
| Bronze (typical) | 950°C (1,742°F) |
| Brass (typical) | 930°C (1,706°F) |
| Silver | 962°C (1,763°F) |
| Gold | 1,064°C (1,947°F) |
| Copper | 1,085°C (1,984°F) |
| Cast Iron | 1,150-1,200°C (2,102-2,192°F) |
| Silicon | 1,414°C (2,577°F) |
| Steel (carbon) | 1,425-1,540°C (2,597-2,804°F) |
| Nickel | 1,455°C (2,651°F) |
| Iron (pure) | 1,538°C (2,800°F) |

**Method**: Place small sample of known material in furnace. When it melts, you've reached that temperature.

**Practical Temperature Control Without Instruments**:

For processes requiring "approximately 1,400°C" (glass) or "approximately 900°C" (ceramics):

1. **Use pyrometric cones** as visual indicators
2. **Use color judgment** (with experience, ±100°C accuracy achievable)
3. **Use melting point samples** (copper scrap melts at 1,085°C → you're above that)
4. **Control fuel/air ratio**:
   - More air (forced draft) = higher temperature
   - Less air = lower temperature
   - Charcoal with forced air blast: 1,200-1,400°C achievable
   - Coal with blast: 1,500-1,600°C
   - Oxygen-enriched: 2,000°C+
5. **Design furnace** with refractory insulation (ceramic fiber, firebrick) to reach and hold high temps
6. **Time/observation**: Learn how long to heat for specific results

**Temperature control is an art as much as science.** Historical glassmakers and smelters achieved precise results without thermometers through experience, observation, and standardized procedures. Document your observations and outcomes to build your own knowledge base.

### Laboratory Safety Equipment Construction

Safety equipment protects against chemical hazards. These can be built from salvage and basic materials.

**Fume Hood** (Critical for Toxic Vapors):

Purpose: Removes hazardous vapors from workspace, preventing inhalation.

**Simple Design** (Chimney Hood):

Construction:
1. **Work surface**: Bench or table against wall
2. **Hood enclosure**:
   - Three walls (back + two sides) extending above work surface
   - Height: 24-36 inches above bench
   - Width: 36-48 inches
   - Depth: 24-30 inches
   - Material: Wood, metal, or masonry
   - Front is open (working area)
3. **Collection hood**:
   - Top narrows to chimney opening
   - Funnel shape concentrates airflow
   - Opening: 8-12 inch diameter
4. **Chimney/vent**:
   - Extends outdoors or to roof
   - Minimum 12 feet tall for good draft
   - Metal pipe, masonry, or wood (lined with metal if acids used)
   - Cap to prevent rain entry

**Operation**:
- Natural draft pulls fumes up and out
- Taller chimney = stronger draft
- Can add fan/blower for forced ventilation (if electricity available)
- Place heat source (burner) at back of hood
- Fumes rise with hot air, flow up chimney

**Improved Design** (With Sash):
- Add movable glass or clear plastic front panel (sash)
- Sash slides up/down or side-to-side
- Provides protection from splashes while allowing access
- Partially closed sash increases airflow velocity (safer)

**Testing Draft**:
- Light smoke source (incense, smoldering paper) at hood opening
- Smoke should be drawn into hood and up chimney
- If smoke escapes forward: Insufficient draft, extend chimney or add fan

**Eye Wash Station** (For Chemical Splashes):

Purpose: Immediate washing of chemical splashes to eyes (time-critical—seconds matter).

**Gravity-Fed Design**:

Construction:
1. **Water reservoir**:
   - 5-10 gallon container (bucket, barrel, tank)
   - Mounted 4-6 feet above eye level
   - Clean water only (distilled or purified)
   - Change weekly (bacteria growth)
2. **Valve**:
   - Large-bore valve (quick flow)
   - Pull-chain or lever operated (not screw valve—too slow)
   - Stays open when activated (hands-free operation)
3. **Nozzles**:
   - Two nozzles, spaced for both eyes
   - Direct gentle streams toward eyes
   - Flow rate: Minimum 0.4 gallons per minute per eye
   - Avoid high pressure (painful, causes more damage)
4. **Basin** (optional):
   - Catches water runoff
   - Prevents flooding floor
   - Drainage to outside or collection bucket

**Operation**:
- Pull chain/lever to open valve
- Lean forward, hold eyes open with fingers
- Let water flow over eyes continuously
- Flush minimum 15 minutes for acids/bases, 20+ minutes for serious exposure
- Seek medical help while flushing continues

**Testing**: Operate monthly to ensure valve functions and water flows cleanly.

**Alternative** (No Running Water):
- Keep squeeze bottles of clean water immediately accessible
- Less effective (hard to flush while holding eyes open)
- Better than nothing

**Safety Shower** (For Large Chemical Spills on Body):

Purpose: Rapid washing of chemical spills on skin or clothing.

**Improvised Design**:

Construction:
1. **Water reservoir**:
   - 20-50 gallon container
   - Mounted 7-8 feet high
   - Refill regularly
2. **Shower head**:
   - Large diameter (6-12 inches)
   - Multiple holes for wide spray
   - Covers entire body
3. **Valve**:
   - Pull-chain activated
   - Large bore for high flow
   - Stays open (hands-free)
   - Emergency release (can be activated by stumbling into pull chain)
4. **Platform**:
   - Stand or kneel under shower
   - Drain or basin to catch water
   - Non-slip surface

**Operation**:
- Pull chain to release water
- Remove contaminated clothing under shower (chemical penetrates clothing rapidly)
- Wash entire body, especially affected areas
- Continue 15-20 minutes
- Seek medical help

**Simpler Alternative**:
- Pre-positioned large buckets of water
- Dump over affected person
- Less effective but better than nothing

**Fire Extinguisher / Sand Bucket**:

**Dry Chemical Extinguisher** (For Chemical Fires):
- Baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) in container with scoop
- Throw on small fires
- Smothers flame, releases CO₂ when heated
- Effective for:
  - Solvent fires
  - Electrical fires (non-conductive)
  - Small metal fires (magnesium, sodium)

**Sand Bucket**:
- 5-gallon bucket of dry sand
- Scoop or use bucket to dump
- Smothers fire by excluding oxygen
- Effective for:
  - Liquid fires (oils, solvents)
  - Metal fires
  - Any fire where water is dangerous

**Water Bucket**:
- For ordinary combustibles (paper, wood, cloth)
- DO NOT use on:
  - Oil/grease fires (spreads fire)
  - Electrical fires (electrocution risk)
  - Metal fires (violent reaction)
  - Chemical fires (many chemicals react violently with water)

**CO₂ Extinguisher** (If Available):
- Salvage from vehicles, buildings
- Refill if possible (requires CO₂ cylinder)
- Effective for electrical, solvent, general fires
- Does not leave residue

**Spill Containment**:

**Neutralization Materials**:

For **acid spills**:
- Baking soda (sodium bicarbonate)
- Soda ash (sodium carbonate)
- Lime (calcium oxide or hydroxide)
- Spread on spill, neutralizes acid
- Add slowly (reaction can be vigorous)
- Sweep up residue when neutralized

For **base spills**:
- Citric acid (from citrus, brewing supply)
- Acetic acid (vinegar)
- Dilute hydrochloric acid
- Apply carefully to neutralize
- Flush with water when neutralized

**Absorbent Materials**:
- Sand (cheap, always available)
- Sawdust (organic liquids)
- Clay (cat litter) if salvageable
- Spread on spill, sweep up, dispose safely

**Spill Kit** (Assembled):
- Container with:
  - Baking soda (1 kg)
  - Citric acid or vinegar (500 ml)
  - Sand or absorbent (5 kg)
  - Dustpan and brush
  - Heavy gloves
  - Goggles
  - Disposal bags
- Keep near chemistry work area

**Personal Protective Equipment** (Improvised):

**Eye Protection**:
- Salvage: Safety goggles, welding goggles, swim goggles, face shields
- Improvise: Clear plastic sheet bent to fit face, held with strap
- Minimum: Close-fitting glasses (poor protection but better than nothing)
- **Never** work with hazardous chemicals without eye protection

**Gloves**:
- Ideal: Nitrile or neoprene gloves (chemical-resistant)
- Salvage: Dishwashing gloves (limited protection), rubber gloves
- Leather: Protects against heat, some chemicals (not acids/bases)
- **Know limitations**: Some chemicals penetrate all gloves—minimize exposure time

**Apron**:
- Leather: Protects against splashes, heat
- Rubber/plastic: Protects against liquids
- Heavy cloth: Minimal protection, better than nothing
- Covers torso and legs

**Respiratory Protection**:
- Activated charcoal mask: Removes some vapors (limited capacity)
- Dust mask: Protects against particles, not vapors
- Wet cloth: Minimal protection, emergency use only
- **Best protection**: Proper ventilation (fume hood) so mask not needed

**First Aid Kit** (Chemistry-Specific):

Beyond standard first aid:
- **Burn treatment**: Clean water, sterile dressings
- **Neutralizing agents**: Weak vinegar (acid burns), weak baking soda solution (base burns)
- **Calcium gluconate gel** (if available): For hydrofluoric acid burns (very effective, hard to source)
- **Activated charcoal**: For some poisonings (consult medical guidance)
- **Eyewash solution**: Sterile water or saline

**Emergency Procedures Sign** (Post Prominently):

Create and display:
```
CHEMICAL EMERGENCY PROCEDURES

EYES: Flush 15+ minutes at eyewash, seek medical help
SKIN: Remove clothing, shower 15+ minutes, seek help
INGESTION: DO NOT induce vomiting, drink water, seek help immediately
INHALATION: Move to fresh air, seek help if symptoms persist
FIRE: Evacuate, use appropriate extinguisher (sand for most chemical fires)
SPILL: Contain, neutralize, clean up with proper protection

EMERGENCY CONTACTS: [List local medical, poison control]
```

**Maintenance Schedule**:

- **Weekly**:
  - Test eyewash flow
  - Refill water reservoirs
  - Check spill kit contents
- **Monthly**:
  - Test shower and fume hood
  - Inspect gloves, goggles for damage
  - Replace consumed neutralizing agents
- **Annually**:
  - Deep clean fume hood
  - Replace eyewash/shower water systems
  - Update first aid supplies

**Reality Check**: Safety equipment is unglamorous, seems unnecessary—until the moment you need it. **Chemical injuries happen in seconds; treatment must be immediate.** A $5 bucket of water positioned correctly can prevent permanent blindness. Build safety equipment before you need it.

## Essential Chemicals to Make or Salvage

### Acids

**Sulfuric Acid (H₂SO₄)** - "Oil of Vitriol"
**Uses**: Battery electrolyte, chemical synthesis, metal etching, dehydrating agent

**Salvage**:
- Car batteries (35% solution, dilute battery acid)
- Drain cleaners (concentrated, 93-98%)

**Make from scratch**:

**Method 1: Contact Process** (Modern, Efficient, but Requires Catalyst):
1. **Burn sulfur** → sulfur dioxide (SO₂)
   - S + O₂ → SO₂
2. **Oxidize SO₂** → sulfur trioxide (SO₃)
   - 2SO₂ + O₂ → 2SO₃
   - Requires catalyst at 400-500°C
   - **Catalyst options**:
     - **Platinum**: Most efficient, expensive, hard to acquire
       - Can salvage from catalytic converters (automotive)
       - Tiny amounts work (catalyst not consumed)
     - **Vanadium pentoxide (V₂O₅)**: Industrial standard
       - Make from vanadium-containing ores (if accessible)
       - Vanadinite, carnotite (uranium ore also contains vanadium)
     - **Iron oxide + potassium sulfate**: Historical alternative
       - Less efficient but achievable
       - Mix iron oxide (rust) with potassium sulfate, heat to form active catalyst
     - **NOₓ catalysis**: Nitrogen oxides catalyze reaction
       - Used in lead-chamber process (below)
3. **Dissolve SO₃ in concentrated sulfuric acid** first → oleum (H₂S₂O₇)
   - Then dilute oleum with water → sulfuric acid
   - **Never add SO₃ directly to water** (explosive reaction)
   - Very exothermic! Add slowly with cooling

**Method 2: Lead-Chamber Process** (Older, Less Efficient, No Precious Catalyst Needed):
- Historical process, achievable with simpler equipment
- Produces ~60-70% sulfuric acid (vs 98% from contact process)
- Process:
  1. **Burn sulfur** with saltpeter (potassium nitrate) → SO₂ + nitrogen oxides (NOₓ)
     - Nitrogen oxides act as catalyst
  2. **React in large lead-lined chamber** with water vapor
     - SO₂ + NO₂ + H₂O → H₂SO₄ + NO
     - NO reacts with O₂ → NO₂ (catalyst regenerates)
  3. **Collect dilute acid** from bottom of chamber
  4. **Concentrate** by boiling (energy-intensive)
- **Advantages**: No platinum needed, simpler process
- **Disadvantages**: Lower concentration, requires large chambers, less efficient
- Lead chamber construction:
  - Wood frame lined with sheet lead
  - Must be large (10+ feet per side for practical production)
  - Lead withstands sulfuric acid corrosion

**Concentrate dilute acid**:
- Boil gently (water boils off first, concentrating acid)
- Acid reaches 98.3% concentration at azeotrope (boiling point 337°C)
- Cannot concentrate beyond 98.3% by simple boiling (azeotrope limit)
- For anhydrous (100%) sulfuric acid: Add sulfur trioxide (SO₃) or use chemical drying agents (very difficult)

**WARNING**: Concentrated sulfuric acid is extremely corrosive and dehydrates organic matter (including you). Diluting concentrated acid generates huge amounts of heat.

**Hydrochloric Acid (HCl)** - "Muriatic Acid"
**Uses**: Metal etching, pH adjustment, chemical synthesis, cleaning

**Salvage**:
- Pool/masonry supply (sold as muriatic acid, 30-35%)

**Make from scratch**:
1. **Salt + Sulfuric acid** → hydrogen chloride gas
   - NaCl + H₂SO₄ → HCl(gas) + NaHSO₄
2. **Dissolve HCl gas in water** → hydrochloric acid
   - Very soluble, creates acid easily
   - Vapors are highly corrosive, work with good ventilation

**Nitric Acid (HNO₃)**
**Uses**: Oxidizer, etching, explosives, chemical synthesis

**Salvage**: Harder to find (some metal etching products)

**Make from scratch**:
1. **Saltpeter (potassium nitrate) + Sulfuric acid** → nitric acid
   - KNO₃ + H₂SO₄ → HNO₃ + KHSO₄
2. **Heat gently** (keep below 83°C—the azeotropic boiling point of 68% nitric acid)
   - Above 83°C, water boils off preferentially, losing acid to vapor
   - Nitric acid itself decomposes above ~120°C to nitrogen dioxide (toxic brown fumes)
3. **Distill** nitric acid vapor into cooled collection flask
4. **Result**: ~68% nitric acid (azeotrope concentration, cannot concentrate further by simple distillation)

**WARNING**: Nitric acid is a powerful oxidizer. Contact with organic materials can cause fire. Vapors are toxic.

**Acetic Acid (CH₃COOH)** - Vinegar
**Uses**: Solvent, pH adjustment, food preservation, chemical synthesis

**Salvage**: Store-bought vinegar (5% acetic acid)

**Make from scratch**:
1. **Ferment alcohol** with acetobacter bacteria (in air)
   - Wine/beer + air + time → vinegar
2. **Distill** to concentrate to ~20% (higher concentrations damage distillation equipment)

**Concentrate**: Freeze vinegar, ice forms first (mostly water), drain liquid (higher concentration)

### Bases

**Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH)** - Lye, Caustic Soda
**Uses**: Soap making, pH adjustment, chemical synthesis, aluminum etching

**Salvage**: Drain cleaners (pure NaOH crystals or pellets)

**Make from scratch**:
1. **Electrolysis of salt water**:
   - Positive electrode (anode): Chlorine gas produced
   - Negative electrode (cathode): Hydrogen gas + sodium hydroxide solution
2. **Evaporate water** → solid NaOH
3. **Alternative**: Lime + soda ash → caustic soda (older method)

**WARNING**: Extremely corrosive. Dissolving NaOH in water generates heat. Can cause blindness if splashed in eyes.

**Potassium Hydroxide (KOH)** - Caustic Potash
**Uses**: Similar to NaOH, better for some electrochemistry

**Make**: Electrolysis of potassium chloride solution (instead of sodium chloride)

**Calcium Hydroxide (Ca(OH)₂)** - Slaked Lime
**Uses**: Water treatment, making caustic soda, mortar/plaster

**Make from scratch**:
1. **Burn limestone (calcium carbonate)** at 900°C
   - CaCO₃ → CaO (quicklime) + CO₂
2. **Add water to quicklime**
   - CaO + H₂O → Ca(OH)₂
   - **WARNING**: Extremely exothermic, can cause burns and fires

**Ammonia (NH₃)**
**Uses**: Fertilizer, cleaning, pH adjustment, chemical synthesis, refrigeration

**Salvage**: Cleaning products (solutions of ammonia in water)

**Make from scratch**:
1. **Haber process** (industrial, difficult):
   - N₂ (from air) + H₂ (from water or methane) → NH₃
   - Requires high pressure (200+ atmospheres), high temperature (400-500°C), catalyst (iron)
   - Very difficult for small scale
2. **Simpler method**: Heat ammonium salts with base
   - Ammonium chloride + calcium hydroxide → ammonia gas + calcium chloride + water
   - Collect ammonia gas in water

### Solvents

**Water (H₂O)**
**Uses**: Universal solvent for polar substances

**Distilled water**:
- Boil water, condense steam
- Critical for batteries, electronics cleaning, chemistry
- Tap water contains minerals that can damage batteries and circuits

### Water Quality for Chemistry (Critical for Many Processes)

Water purity requirements vary by application. Understanding and achieving appropriate water quality is essential for success.

**Water Purity Levels:**

1. **Potable Water** (Drinking Quality):
   - Free from pathogens, low dissolved solids
   - Acceptable for: Washing equipment, initial rinsing, some industrial chemistry
   - Not acceptable for: Batteries, precision chemistry, semiconductor work

2. **Distilled Water** (Single Distillation):
   - Conductivity: ~1-5 μS/cm (microsiemens per centimeter)
   - Most minerals removed
   - Acceptable for: Batteries, most chemistry, electroplating, general lab work
   - Not acceptable for: Semiconductor processing, ultra-precision work
   - Production: Boil water, condense steam, discard first fraction (volatile contaminants)

3. **Double-Distilled Water** (Redistilled):
   - Conductivity: ~0.1-1 μS/cm
   - Very pure, most trace contaminants removed
   - Acceptable for: Precision chemistry, critical battery applications
   - Production: Distill distilled water again in clean glass apparatus

4. **Deionized Water** (Ion Exchange):
   - Conductivity: <0.1 μS/cm achievable
   - Ions removed by exchange resins
   - May still contain organic contaminants (bacteria, dissolved organics)
   - Acceptable for: Semiconductor work (if combined with filtration), critical applications
   - Production requires: Ion exchange resins (complex to make, see below)

**Testing Water Purity** (Without Modern Instruments):

**Evaporation Test** (Dissolved Solids):
1. Evaporate 100 ml water in clean glass dish
2. Examine residue
3. Pure water: No visible residue or faint white film
4. Impure water: Visible crystals, scale, or colored residue
5. Quantify: Weigh residue (if scale available)
   - Distilled water: <10 mg/L (10 ppm) total dissolved solids
   - Tap water: 50-500 mg/L typical

**Conductivity Test** (Ion Content):
- Pure water conducts electricity very poorly
- Dissolved ions increase conductivity dramatically
- Simple test (if you have battery and sensitive meter):
  1. Place electrodes 1 cm apart in water
  2. Apply small voltage (1-5V)
  3. Measure current
  4. Pure water: Very low current (nanoamperes)
  5. Tap water: Measurable current (microamperes to milliamperes)
- Without instruments: Must use evaporation test

**Visual Clarity Test**:
1. Fill tall glass cylinder with water
2. Hold to light
3. Look for: Turbidity (cloudiness), color, floating particles
4. Pure water: Crystal clear, colorless
5. Test sensitivity: Can you read small text through 30 cm of water?

**pH Test** (Acidity/Alkalinity):
- Pure water should be neutral (pH 7)
- Use red cabbage indicator or pH paper
- Dissolved CO₂ from air makes water slightly acidic (pH 5.5-6.5) — this is normal
- Strong color indicates contamination

**Making Deionized Water** (Ion Exchange Resins):

Ion exchange resins swap dissolved ions for H⁺ or OH⁻, effectively removing minerals.

**Resin Types:**
- **Cation resin**: Exchanges positive ions (Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺, Na⁺) for H⁺
- **Anion resin**: Exchanges negative ions (Cl⁻, SO₄²⁻) for OH⁻
- **Mixed bed**: Both types together (best purity)

**Making Resins** (Very Complex, Tier 3+ Technology):
- Requires: Styrene, divinylbenzene, polymerization, sulfonation/amination
- Not achievable in early reconstruction
- Alternative: Salvage ion exchange resins from water softeners, lab equipment, industrial water treatment

**Using Salvaged Resins:**
1. Obtain resin beads from salvage
2. Clean thoroughly (backwash with distilled water)
3. Regenerate:
   - Cation resin: Flush with strong acid (HCl or H₂SO₄)
   - Anion resin: Flush with strong base (NaOH)
   - Rinse thoroughly until effluent is neutral
4. Pack in column (glass or plastic tube)
5. Flow water through slowly
6. Monitor output purity (conductivity or evaporation test)
7. When purity drops, regenerate again
8. Resins last years if properly maintained

**Column Design:**
- Diameter: 2-4 inches
- Height: 12-24 inches of resin
- Flow rate: 1-5 liters per hour (slow flow = better purity)
- Sequence: Cation resin first, then anion resin (or mixed bed)

**Simpler Alternatives** (If Ion Exchange Unavailable):

**Rainwater Collection**:
- Naturally distilled by evaporation/condensation
- Low mineral content (typically <50 mg/L)
- Collect from clean surfaces (not roofs with bird droppings, pollution)
- First rain after dry period: Discard (washes accumulated dust)
- Subsequent rain: Relatively pure
- Filter to remove particles
- Acceptable for: Batteries, general chemistry (not semiconductor work)

**Lime Softening** (Removes Hardness):
- Add slaked lime (calcium hydroxide) to hard water
- Ca(OH)₂ reacts with dissolved Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺ to form precipitates
- Let settle, filter
- Softens water but doesn't remove all ions
- Acceptable for: Washing, some chemistry (not precision work)

**Filtration Through Activated Charcoal**:
- Removes organic contaminants, chlorine, some metals
- Does not remove dissolved minerals
- Use after distillation for higher purity
- Acceptable for: Improving distilled water quality

**Water Purity Requirements by Application:**

| Application | Minimum Purity | Testing Method |
|-------------|----------------|----------------|
| Battery electrolyte (lead-acid) | Distilled | Evaporation test (<20 ppm solids) |
| Battery electrolyte (NiCd, NiMH) | Double-distilled | Evaporation test (<5 ppm solids) |
| Electroplating | Distilled | Visual clarity + evaporation |
| General chemistry | Distilled | Visual clarity |
| Precision chemistry | Double-distilled or deionized | Conductivity if possible |
| Semiconductor processing | Deionized + filtered | Conductivity <0.1 μS/cm |
| Washing glassware | Distilled (final rinse) | Visual |
| PCB etching | Distilled | Visual + evaporation |

**Storage of Pure Water:**
- Glass or high-quality plastic (HDPE, PP)
- Seal to prevent dust, CO₂ absorption
- Label clearly ("Distilled," "Deionized," date)
- Use within weeks (bacteria can grow, especially in deionized water)
- For long-term storage: Seal in glass, keep cool and dark

**Common Mistakes:**

1. **Using tap water for batteries**: Minerals cause sulfation, reduce battery life drastically
2. **Assuming boiled water = distilled water**: Boiling kills pathogens but doesn't remove minerals
3. **Storing distilled water in metal containers**: Can leach ions back into water
4. **Re-using distillation apparatus without cleaning**: Residues contaminate next batch
5. **Using hard water for steam boilers**: Causes scale buildup, reduces efficiency, can cause explosions

**Distillation Apparatus Care:**
- Clean with acid (HCl or acetic acid) to remove mineral scale
- Rinse thoroughly with already-distilled water before use
- Glass apparatus preferred (metal can leach ions)
- Discard initial distillate fraction (volatile contaminants boil off first)

**Ethanol (C₂H₅OH)** - Alcohol
**Uses**: Solvent, fuel, disinfectant, chemical synthesis

**Make**:
1. **Ferment sugars**: Yeast + sugar/grain → alcohol + CO₂
2. **Distill**: Separates alcohol from water
   - Ethanol boils at 78°C, water at 100°C
   - Can achieve 95-96% ethanol by distillation (azeotrope limit at 95.6% ethanol/4.4% water)
   - Cannot exceed 95.6% by simple distillation
3. **Dehydrate** for 100% (absolute) ethanol:

   *Method 1: Chemical Drying* (Simpler):
   - Add quicklime (calcium oxide, CaO) or anhydrous calcium chloride to 95% ethanol
   - CaO reacts with water: CaO + H₂O → Ca(OH)₂
   - Let sit, then distill off pure ethanol
   - Lime absorbs water but not ethanol

   *Method 2: Molecular Sieves* (Better):
   - Pass ethanol through column of molecular sieves (zeolite)
   - Sieves selectively absorb water, pass ethanol
   - Can achieve 99.5%+ purity
   - Regenerate sieves by heating
   - Sieves must be salvaged (complex to manufacture)

   *Method 3: Azeotropic Distillation* (Industrial):
   - Add benzene or cyclohexane to 95% ethanol
   - Forms ternary azeotrope (benzene-ethanol-water) that boils off first
   - Leaves behind pure ethanol
   - Process:
     1. Add benzene (10-20% by volume) to 95% ethanol
     2. Distill off benzene-ethanol-water azeotrope (boils at 64°C)
     3. Continue distilling until temperature rises to 78°C
     4. Pure ethanol distills at 78°C, collect
   - **WARNING**: Benzene is toxic and carcinogenic; handle with care

**Salvage**: Laundry booster products

**Sources**: Natural deposits in dry lake beds (California, Turkey)

### Flux Materials (Essential for Metalworking and Glass)

Fluxes serve multiple purposes: they remove oxides from metal surfaces, lower melting points, prevent re-oxidation during heating, and help metals flow together. Different applications require different fluxes.

**Borax** (Sodium Tetraborate, Na₂B₄O₇):
- **Uses**:
  - Brazing and forge welding (general-purpose high-temperature flux)
  - Silver soldering
  - Glass making (improves workability, lowers melting point)
  - Pottery glazes
- **Working temperature**: 700-900°C
- **How it works**: Melts and forms glassy coating that dissolves metal oxides
- **Sources**: Salvage from laundry products, natural deposits in dry lakes
- **Preparation**: Use as powder or mix with water to make paste

**Rosin** (Pine Resin):
- **Uses**:
  - Electronics soldering flux (low-temperature, non-corrosive)
  - Electrical work (doesn't conduct electricity after soldering)
  - Violin bows (not flux, but same material)
- **Working temperature**: 180-250°C (melts around 100°C, activates higher)
- **How it works**: Mild acid when heated, cleans oxides without corroding
- **Sources**:
  - Collect from pine trees (sticky sap)
  - Distill turpentine from pine resin (residue is rosin)
- **Preparation**: Heat pine sap gently to evaporate volatiles, strain solids
- **Advantage**: Non-corrosive residue safe for electronics

**Ammonium Chloride** (NH₄Cl, Sal Ammoniac):
- **Uses**:
  - Zinc galvanizing flux (prepares zinc surface)
  - Tinning flux (coating with tin)
  - Soldering flux (more aggressive than rosin, use for non-electronics)
- **Working temperature**: 300-400°C
- **How it works**: Decomposes to HCl gas which dissolves oxides
- **Make**:
  - React ammonia with hydrochloric acid
  - NH₃ + HCl → NH₄Cl (white smoke/crystals)
  - Or collect from soot of burning dung/urine (ancient method)
- **WARNING**: Corrosive residue, must be cleaned after soldering

**Limestone / Calcium Carbonate** (CaCO₃):
- **Uses**:
  - Ironmaking flux (removes sand, silica impurities from iron ore)
  - Steelmaking (removes sulfur and phosphorus)
  - Smelting fluxes generally
- **Working temperature**: 900°C+ (decomposes to CaO at 900°C)
- **How it works**: Reacts with silica to form slag (calcium silicate)
  - CaCO₃ → CaO + CO₂ (at temperature)
  - CaO + SiO₂ → CaSiO₃ (slag, floats on molten iron)
- **Sources**: Natural limestone deposits, seashells, coral, chalk
- **Preparation**: Crush to appropriate size (pea-sized for blast furnace)

**Fluorite / Fluorspar** (CaF₂):
- **Uses**:
  - Steelmaking flux (very effective, lowers melting point significantly)
  - Aluminum smelting
  - High-temperature metallurgy
- **Working temperature**: 1000°C+
- **How it works**: Forms very fluid slag, dissolves impurities readily
- **Sources**: Natural fluorite deposits (often purple/green crystals)
- **WARNING**: Produces toxic hydrogen fluoride (HF) if exposed to acids or moisture at high temp
  - Use with good ventilation
  - Avoid breathing fumes

**Cryolite** (Na₃AlF₆):
- **Uses**:
  - Aluminum smelting (dissolves alumina, lowers melting point from 2000°C to 900°C)
  - Essential for industrial aluminum production
- **Sources**: Natural deposits (Greenland, historically), now mostly synthesized
- **Make** (complex):
  - React aluminum hydroxide with HF and NaOH
  - Requires handling highly dangerous hydrofluoric acid
- **Not recommended for early reconstruction** (aluminum smelting is Tier 2-3 technology)

**Muriatic Acid / Hydrochloric Acid** (HCl, dilute):
- **Uses**:
  - Cleaning metals before soldering (removes rust, scale)
  - Pickling steel (removing oxide scale after forging/rolling)
  - Not a flux per se, but prepares surfaces for fluxes to work
- **Preparation**: Dilute concentrated HCl with water (see Acids section)
- **Application**: Dip metal briefly, rinse with water, dry, then apply flux and solder

**Petroleum Jelly / Grease**:
- **Uses**:
  - Improvised soldering flux (very low temperature)
  - Pipe fitting (plumbing solder)
- **Working temperature**: Up to 200°C
- **How it works**: Excludes air, prevents oxidation during soldering
- **Limitations**: Doesn't actively clean oxides, only prevents new oxidation

**Flux Application Guidelines**:

1. **Match flux to temperature**:
   - Electronics (<250°C): Rosin
   - Plumbing, tin/lead solder (250-350°C): Rosin or ammonium chloride
   - Silver brazing (600-800°C): Borax
   - Forge welding (1000°C+): Borax or specialized formulas

2. **Match flux to metal**:
   - Copper, brass, bronze: Rosin (electronics) or borax (high-temp)
   - Steel, iron: Borax (forging), limestone (smelting)
   - Aluminum: Specialized fluoride fluxes (difficult)
   - Zinc (galvanizing): Ammonium chloride

3. **Clean residues**:
   - Rosin: Relatively safe to leave (electronics), or clean with alcohol
   - Ammonium chloride: Must remove (corrosive), wash with water
   - Borax: Wash off with water, forms glassy residue

4. **Storage**:
   - Keep fluxes dry (most absorb moisture)
   - Label clearly (especially corrosive types)
   - Borax and rosin: indefinite shelf life
   - Ammonium chloride: store in sealed container (sublimes slowly)

**Sulfur (S)**
**Uses**: Sulfuric acid synthesis, gunpowder, vulcanizing rubber, fungicide

**Sourcing**:
1. **Volcanic deposits**: Yellow sulfur found near hot springs, volcanic vents
   - Often nearly pure
   - Collect, melt (115°C melting point), filter impurities
2. **Gypsum reduction** (calcium sulfate → sulfur):
   - Heat gypsum (CaSO₄·2H₂O) with charcoal to high temperature
   - CaSO₄ + 4C → CaS + 4CO
   - React calcium sulfide with acid to produce H₂S gas
   - 2H₂S + O₂ → 2S + 2H₂O (burn H₂S in limited oxygen)
   - Complex but works if volcanic sulfur unavailable
3. **Pyrite roasting** (iron sulfide):
   - Heat pyrite (FeS₂) in air
   - 4FeS₂ + 11O₂ → 2Fe₂O₃ + 8SO₂
   - Produces sulfur dioxide for sulfuric acid, not elemental sulfur
   - Leaves iron oxide (useful for pigments, smelting)
4. **Salvage sources**:
   - Fertilizers (often contain sulfates)
   - Industrial chemicals
   - Matches (small quantities)

**Refining**: Melt sulfur at 115-120°C, let impurities settle, pour off pure liquid sulfur into molds

### Charcoal Production (Essential Reducing Agent)

Charcoal is critical for chemistry and metallurgy. It provides carbon for reduction reactions (removing oxygen from metal oxides), fuel for high-temperature processes, and activated charcoal for filtration and medicine.

**Why Charcoal, Not Wood?**:
- Wood burns with flame, charcoal burns without (almost pure carbon)
- Higher temperature (charcoal burns hotter)
- Less smoke and impurities
- More consistent chemical properties

**Wood Selection**:
- **Hardwoods preferred**: Oak, hickory, maple, beech, birch
- Higher density → more charcoal per volume
- **Softwoods acceptable**: Pine, fir (produce less charcoal, more tar)
- Seasoned (dry) wood essential (green wood produces poor charcoal)
- Yield: ~20-25% by weight from dry hardwood (100 lbs wood → 20-25 lbs charcoal)

**Methods**:

**1. Pit Kiln** (Simplest, Oldest):
- Dig pit 3-4 feet deep, 4-6 feet diameter
- Fill with wood, stacked tightly
- Cover with layer of leaves or grass (allows some airflow)
- Cover with 6-8 inches of dirt (seals against too much oxygen)
- Leave small vent holes around perimeter
- Ignite wood through central chimney or vent
- Let burn slowly (smoldering, not flaming)
- Close vents when smoke turns thin and blue (indicates charcoal forming)
- Let cool 12-24 hours
- Dig out charcoal
- Yield: Lower (much lost to burning), but requires no equipment

**2. Mound Kiln** (Traditional Charcoal Pile):
- Stack wood in conical mound 6-10 feet high
- Leave central chimney space
- Cover with layer of straw or leaves
- Cover with dirt or turf (6-8 inches thick)
- Ignite from top chimney
- Control airflow with vents at base
- Monitor smoke (white = moisture, yellow/brown = wood gases, thin blue = charcoaling complete)
- Process takes 3-7 days
- Seal all vents, let cool 1-2 days
- Yield: ~20-25% by weight

**3. Retort (Metal Drum/Container)**:
- Use steel drum with small vent hole in lid
- Fill with wood, seal (except vent)
- Heat drum externally (fire around it)
- Wood gases and smoke escape through vent (can be collected for wood tar, methanol)
- When smoke turns thin and stops flowing, heating is complete
- Let cool completely before opening (air causes charcoal to burn)
- Yield: Higher (~25-30% by weight), cleaner charcoal
- **Advantage**: Can collect wood distillation products:
  - Wood tar (waterproofing, preservative)
  - Methanol / wood alcohol (solvent, fuel)
  - Acetic acid (vinegar)

**Quenching** (Optional):
- Some methods quench hot charcoal with water spray to stop burning
- Produces fragile charcoal, loses some quality
- Dry cooling (sealing without quenching) produces better charcoal

**Activated Charcoal** (For Filtration, Medicine):
- Take regular charcoal
- Heat to 800-900°C in steam or CO₂ atmosphere
- Creates microscopic pores (increases surface area enormously)
- Use for water filtration, poison treatment, gas mask filters
- Process requires precise temperature control

**Storage**:
- Keep dry (charcoal absorbs moisture from air)
- Store in sealed containers or covered shed
- Damp charcoal doesn't burn well and loses effectiveness

**Uses in Chemistry**:
- Silicon production: SiO₂ + 2C → Si + 2CO (1,900°C)
- Iron smelting: Fe₂O₃ + 3C → 2Fe + 3CO
- Calcium carbide: CaO + 3C → CaC₂ + CO (for acetylene generation)
- General reducing agent for any metal oxide reduction
- Fuel for furnaces, forges, crucibles

**Safety**:
- Charcoal produces carbon monoxide (CO) when burning
- Never burn charcoal indoors without ventilation (CO is odorless, deadly)
- Freshly made charcoal can spontaneously ignite if not cooled completely
- Fine charcoal dust is explosive (keep away from sparks)

## Materials Synthesis

### Glass Making

**Basic Glass** (Soda-Lime Glass):
**Recipe**:
- 70% Silicon dioxide (SiO₂): Sand

5. **Form while molten**:
   - Pour into mold (casting)
   - Blow into bubble (bottles, bulbs)
   - Roll flat (sheet glass)
6. **Anneal**: Cool slowly to prevent cracking
   - Hold at 500-550°C for hours
   - Slow cool to room temperature

**Specialty Glasses**:
- **Borosilicate (Pyrex)**: Add boron oxide, more heat-resistant
- **Lead crystal**: Add lead oxide, higher refractive index (optics)

**Glassworking**:
- Heat to 600-800°C (softening point)
- Shape with tools, blow, or press
- Cool slowly

### Ceramics

**Clay**:
**Sources**: Natural clay deposits (test by rolling into snake—if it holds shape, it's clay)

**Process**:
1. **Purify**: Remove rocks, organic matter
2. **Mix with water** to consistency
3. **Form**: Hand-shape, throw on wheel, or press into mold
4. **Dry**: Slowly, to prevent cracking
5. **Fire**: Heat to 900-1,300°C depending on clay type
   - Low fire: Earthenware (porous)
   - High fire: Stoneware, porcelain (impermeable)

**Glazing**:
- Apply glass mixture to ceramic surface
- Fire again, glass melts and fuses
- Creates waterproof, smooth surface

**Technical ceramics**:
- Alumina: Electrical insulators, high-temperature applications
- Porcelain: Insulators, chemical-resistant vessels

### Plastics and Polymers

- Hard, heat-resistant, electrical insulator
- Critical for early electronics (insulators, circuit boards, vacuum tube sockets)

**Phenol Production** (Required Feedstock):

Phenol (C₆H₅OH, carbolic acid) is aromatic alcohol. Historical sources:

*Method 1: Coal Tar Distillation* (Easiest Post-Collapse):
1. **Destructive distillation of coal**:
   - Heat coal (1,000°C) in absence of air (retort, sealed chamber)
   - Produces: Coal gas, coal tar, coke
2. **Coal tar fractionation**:
   - Coal tar is complex mixture
   - Distill at different temperatures:
     - 170-230°C: Light oils (benzene, toluene, xylene)
     - 230-270°C: Middle oils (naphthalene, phenol, cresols)
     - 270-400°C: Heavy oils (anthracene, phenanthrene)
   - Phenol concentrates in middle oil fraction
3. **Separation of phenol**:
   - Treat middle oil with sodium hydroxide solution
   - Phenol + NaOH → sodium phenoxide (water-soluble) + other oils (insoluble)
   - Separate layers, discard oil layer
   - Acidify sodium phenoxide with HCl or H₂SO₄
   - Phenol precipitates out
   - Distill to purify (phenol boils at 182°C)

Yield: Coal tar is ~3-5% of coal weight, phenol is ~2-3% of coal tar
From 1 ton coal → ~1-1.5 kg phenol (crude estimate)

*Method 2: Benzene Sulfonation* (More Complex, Higher Purity):
1. **Benzene + sulfuric acid** → benzenesulfonic acid
   - C₆H₆ + H₂SO₄ → C₆H₅SO₃H + H₂O
   - Heat required (~80°C), concentrated sulfuric acid
2. **Neutralize with base**:
   - C₆H₅SO₃H + 2NaOH → C₆H₅SO₃Na (sodium benzenesulfonate) + H₂O
3. **Alkali fusion**:
   - Heat sodium benzenesulfonate with excess NaOH (300-350°C)
   - C₆H₅SO₃Na + 2NaOH → C₆H₅ONa (sodium phenoxide) + Na₂SO₃ + H₂O
4. **Acidify**:
   - C₆H₅ONa + HCl → C₆H₅OH (phenol) + NaCl
   - Distill to purify

Requires: Benzene (from coal tar or petroleum), concentrated sulfuric acid, sodium hydroxide, high heat

*Method 3: Cumene Process* (Modern, Very Complex):
- Requires: Benzene, propylene (from petroleum cracking), oxygen, catalysts
- Multi-step process involving cumene intermediate
- Not recommended for post-collapse (too complex, petroleum-dependent)

**Safety**: Phenol is toxic and corrosive. Causes severe chemical burns. Absorbs through skin. Handle with gloves, avoid skin contact, work with ventilation.

**Formaldehyde Production** (Required Feedstock):

Formaldehyde (CH₂O, methanal) is simplest aldehyde. Critical for Bakelite and preservatives.

*Method 1: Methanol Oxidation* (Standard Industrial Process):
1. **Obtain methanol** (wood alcohol):
   - Destructive distillation of wood (see below)
   - OR synthesis from carbon monoxide + hydrogen (complex)
2. **Catalytic oxidation**:
   - Pass methanol vapor + air over heated catalyst (400-600°C)
   - Catalyst: Copper metal, or silver metal, or iron oxide-molybdenum oxide
   - Reaction: 2CH₃OH + O₂ → 2CH₂O + 2H₂O
   - Exothermic (produces heat, self-sustaining after startup)
3. **Collect formaldehyde**:
   - Formaldehyde is gas at room temperature (boiling point -19°C)
   - Absorb in water → formalin (37-40% formaldehyde solution)
   - Or use immediately as gas

Catalyst options:
- **Copper**: Easiest, use copper wire mesh or powder, works at 600°C
- **Silver**: More efficient, use silver wire or gauze, works at 400-500°C
- **Iron oxide-molybdenum**: Industrial standard, complex to prepare

*Methanol Production from Wood* (Wood Alcohol):
1. **Destructive distillation of hardwood**:
   - Heat dry hardwood (beech, maple, birch preferred) in sealed retort (no air)
   - Temperature: 400-500°C
   - Products:
     - Wood gas (flammable, can fuel the process)
     - Wood tar (by-product)
     - Pyroligneous acid (crude liquid containing methanol, acetic acid, acetone)
     - Charcoal (solid residue)
2. **Separation of methanol**:
   - Distill pyroligneous acid
   - First fraction (60-65°C): Mostly methanol with some acetone
   - Later fraction (100-120°C): Acetic acid and water
   - Redistill methanol fraction for purity
   - Dry with quicklime or molecular sieves if needed

Yield: ~2-3% methanol by weight of dry wood (e.g., 100 kg wood → 2-3 kg crude methanol)

**Alternative**: Purchase or salvage methanol (antifreeze, fuel additive, industrial solvent)

*Method 2: Direct Wood Oxidation* (Less Efficient):
- Some formaldehyde forms during wood destructive distillation
- Recover from pyroligneous acid
- Low yield, not preferred

**Safety**: Formaldehyde is toxic, carcinogenic, irritating to eyes/lungs. Handle formalin solutions in ventilated area. Avoid breathing vapors.

**Bakelite Synthesis** (Now with Feedstock Sources):

With phenol and formaldehyde available:

1. **Mix reactants**:
   - Phenol: 1 part (by weight)
   - Formaldehyde (37% formalin): 0.8-1 part
   - Catalyst: 1-5% acid (HCl or oxalic acid) or base (NaOH)
   - Acid catalyst → faster cure, more brittle
   - Base catalyst → slower cure, tougher product

2. **Heat** (Stage 1 - Resole or Novolac formation):
   - Heat to 80-100°C with stirring
   - Reaction begins, generates heat
   - Continue heating 30-60 minutes
   - Resin becomes thick, syrupy (don't let fully harden yet)

3. **Add fillers** (improves properties, reduces cost):
   - Wood flour (sawdust ground fine): 40-60% by weight
   - Asbestos fibers (if available, but carcinogenic - avoid)
   - Cotton fibers, paper pulp, mica powder (alternatives)
   - Mix thoroughly while resin still liquid

4. **Mold** (Stage 2 - Curing under heat and pressure):
   - Pour/pack resin+filler into mold
   - Heat to 140-180°C
   - Apply pressure (several tons per square inch for compression molding)
   - Or use transfer molding (force heated resin into mold)
   - Hold 10-30 minutes depending on thickness
   - Resin cross-links, hardens irreversibly

5. **Cool and remove**:
   - Let cool slowly in mold
   - Remove part
   - Further post-cure at 120-150°C for hours improves properties

**Properties**:
- Hard, rigid, cannot be remelted
- Heat-resistant (up to 300°C)
- Excellent electrical insulator
- Chemical-resistant (acids, bases, solvents)
- Machinable (can drill, cut, thread)

**Applications**:
- Vacuum tube sockets and bases
- Electrical switch housings
- Insulators for circuits
- Radio cabinets
- Tool handles
- Early circuit boards (phenolic paper laminate)

**5. Polyethylene**:

- Requires high pressure or catalyst
- Results in versatile plastic (bags, bottles, pipes)

**6. PVC (Polyvinyl Chloride)**:
- Polymerize vinyl chloride (from ethylene + chlorine)
- Rigid or flexible depending on plasticizers
- Pipes, insulation, sheets

**Rubber**:

**Natural rubber**:
- Latex from rubber trees
- Coagulate with acid
- Wash and dry
- **Vulcanize**: Heat with sulfur to cross-link polymer
  - Makes rubber elastic and durable
  - Process: 130-150°C with 2-5% sulfur

**Synthetic rubber**:
- Various recipes (styrene-butadiene, neoprene, etc.)
- Require petroleum feedstocks
- Complex chemistry

### Semiconductors (Critical for Electronics)

**Silicon Purification** (Most Important Semiconductor):

**Stage 1: Metallurgical Grade Silicon** (98% pure):
1. **Reduce silicon dioxide (sand) with carbon**:
   - SiO₂ + 2C → Si + 2CO
2. **Heat in electric arc furnace** (1,900°C+)
3. **Result**: Lumpy, impure silicon

**Stage 2: Electronic Grade Silicon** (99.9999999% pure - "nine nines"):
1. **React with HCl**:
   - Si + 3HCl → SiHCl₃ (trichlorosilane) + H₂
2. **Distill** trichlorosilane (purification by boiling point)
3. **Reduce back to silicon**:
   - SiHCl₃ + H₂ → Si + 3HCl (at 1,100°C)
   - Deposit on pure silicon rod
4. **Result**: Polycrystalline silicon

**Stage 3: Single Crystal Silicon**:
1. **Czochralski process**:
   - Melt polycrystalline silicon (1,414°C)
   - Touch with seed crystal
   - Slowly pull up while rotating
   - Silicon crystallizes in single crystal structure
   - Forms cylindrical ingot (boule)
2. **Slice into wafers**: Diamond saw, thin discs
3. **Polish**: Mirror-smooth surface

**Doping** (Creating N-type and P-type):
- **N-type**: Add phosphorus or arsenic (extra electrons)
- **P-type**: Add boron or gallium (electron holes)
- **Process**:
  - Diffusion: Heat wafer in atmosphere of dopant
  - Ion implantation: Shoot dopant ions into silicon (needs particle accelerator)

**Reality Check**: This is extremely difficult and requires:
- High-temperature furnaces
- Ultra-clean environment (dust particles ruin chips)
- Precise control
- Expensive equipment

**Recommendation**: Salvage silicon chips as long as possible. Manufacturing is Tier 4 technology (decades away).

**Germanium** (Earlier Semiconductor):
- Easier to purify than silicon
- Lower performance than silicon
- Used in early transistors
- Similar purification process to silicon
- Consider for first transistor manufacturing attempts

### Explosives (Handle with Extreme Care)

**Black Powder** (Gunpowder):
**Recipe**:
- 75% Potassium nitrate (saltpeter)
- 15% Charcoal (fine powder)
- 10% Sulfur

**Process**:
1. **Grind each ingredient separately** to fine powder
2. **Mix thoroughly** (wet mixing safer than dry)
3. **Dry slowly**
4. **Optional**: Press into cakes and break into grains

**Uses**: Firearms, mining, quarrying, fireworks
**WARNING**: Friction, sparks, or impact can ignite. Never grind all ingredients together dry (can explode).

**Dynamite** (Nitroglycerin + absorbent):
**DANGER**: Nitroglycerin is extremely unstable and has killed many chemists. Only attempt if you have proper training and need.

**Process** (for reference only):
1. **Make nitroglycerin**: Glycerol + nitric acid + sulfuric acid
   - Must be done at low temperature (below 30°C)
   - Extremely dangerous
2. **Absorb in diatomaceous earth** or similar
3. **Result**: Relatively stable explosive

**Strong recommendation**: Stick to black powder. Dynamite is too dangerous without proper facilities.

## Electrochemistry

**Electrolysis**: Use electricity to drive chemical reactions

**Basic Setup**:
- Power source (battery or generator, DC current)
- Electrodes (anode = positive, cathode = negative)
- Electrolyte (solution that conducts electricity)

**Applications**:

**1. Electroplating**:
- Coat one metal with another
- Example: Copper plating
  - Anode: Copper
  - Cathode: Object to plate
  - Electrolyte: Copper sulfate solution
  - Current: Copper dissolves from anode, deposits on cathode

**2. Anodizing**:
- Create oxide layer on aluminum
- Protection and coloring
- Electrolyte: Sulfuric acid
- Aluminum as anode, oxide forms on surface

**3. Refining Metals**:
- Purify copper, gold, silver
- Impure metal as anode, dissolves
- Pure metal deposits on cathode
- Impurities fall to bottom or stay in solution

**4. Making Chemicals**:
- Chlorine and sodium hydroxide from salt water
- Hydrogen and oxygen from water
- Manganese dioxide (for batteries) from manganese salts

## Chemical Processes for Electronics

### Etching Printed Circuit Boards

**Ferric Chloride Method**:

1. **Make ferric chloride** (FeCl₃):
   - Dissolve iron (nails, wire, filings) in hydrochloric acid → ferrous chloride
     - Fe + 2HCl → FeCl₂ + H₂ (gas bubbles)
   - Oxidize ferrous chloride (Fe²⁺) to ferric chloride (Fe³⁺):
     - Add hydrogen peroxide: FeCl₂ + H₂O₂ + 2HCl → FeCl₃ + 2H₂O
     - OR bubble air/oxygen through solution (slower)
   - Result: Yellow-brown ferric chloride solution (the etchant)
   - The hydrogen peroxide oxidizes Fe²⁺ to Fe³⁺, which is the active etching species

2. **Prepare board**: Copper-clad board with resist pattern (paint, tape, photoresist)

3. **Etch**: Submerge in ferric chloride, exposed copper dissolves
   - Reaction: FeCl₃ + Cu → FeCl₂ + CuCl (copper dissolves)

4. **Wash and remove resist**

**Alternative**: Cupric chloride, ammonium persulfate

### Photoresist (For Fine Patterns)

**Concept**: Light-sensitive chemical that hardens (or softens) when exposed

**DIY Photoresist**:
- Bitumen (asphalt) dissolved in solvent
- Coat board, dry
- Expose to UV light through mask (transparent pattern)
- Develop in solvent, removes unexposed areas
- Etch exposed copper

**Modern photoresist**: Complex polymers, better resolution, but harder to make

### Cleaning and Surface Preparation

- **Isopropyl alcohol**: Clean flux, oils
- **Acetone**: Remove adhesives, plastics
- **Flux removers**: After soldering
- **Ultrasonic cleaner**: Vibrations clean intricate parts (if you have electronics to build one)

## Quality Control

**Purity Testing**:
- **Melting point**: Pure substances have sharp melting points
- **Boiling point**: Identify and verify purity
- **Density**: Weigh and measure volume
- **Chemical tests**: Specific reactions identify substances

**Titration**:
- Determine concentration of acid or base
- Add standardized base to acid (or vice versa) until neutralization
- Use indicator to detect endpoint
