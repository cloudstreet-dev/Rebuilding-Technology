# 04.5 Paper and Printing

## Critical Priority Warning

**THIS GUIDE MUST BE COPIED IMMEDIATELY**

You are reading knowledge that could save civilization. Paper decays. Books burn. Digital storage fails without electricity. The only way to preserve this information is to reproduce it on durable paper with permanent ink and distribute copies widely.

If you have found this guide, your first technological priority after securing food, water, and shelter is to establish paper and printing production. Every month without copies is a month where fire, flood, or simple deterioration could destroy humanity's accumulated knowledge.

**A civilization with printing can rebuild. A civilization without it will forget.**

## Why Paper and Printing Matter

In the pre-digital age, paper and printing were the foundation of knowledge preservation and advancement. A single printing press can produce hundreds of book copies in the time it would take to hand-copy one. This technology:

- Preserves knowledge across generations
- Enables widespread education
- Standardizes technical information
- Allows rapid dissemination of discoveries
- Creates redundancy against knowledge loss
- Facilitates commerce and organization
- Provides permanent records

Books printed on quality rag paper with iron gall ink have survived 500+ years. The Gutenberg Bible, printed in 1455, remains readable today. Digital storage requires continuous power and technology chains. Paper requires only light and dry conditions.

**Your mission: Print this guide. Print it again. Distribute it everywhere.**

## Paper Production from Plant Fibers

Paper is felted plant fibers, suspended in water, then pressed and dried into sheets. Almost any plant material can make paper, though some are far better than others.

### Suitable Materials (Ranked by Quality)

**Cotton and Linen Rags** (Best quality, 500+ year lifespan)
- Old clothes, sheets, sails
- Already processed fibers
- Makes strongest, most durable paper
- This is what you want for permanent records

**Hemp** (Excellent quality, very strong)
- Fast-growing crop
- Long, strong fibers
- Makes durable paper
- Easy to cultivate

**Flax** (Excellent quality)
- Same plant that makes linen
- Very long fibers
- Smooth, fine paper
- Good for detailed printing

**Wood Pulp** (Moderate quality, 50-100 year lifespan)
- Most abundant material
- Softwoods (pine, spruce) have longer fibers than hardwoods
- Requires more processing
- Contains lignin which causes yellowing and brittleness
- Acceptable for temporary documents

**Papyrus** (Ancient Egyptian method)
- Pith of papyrus reed, laid crosswise and pressed
- Not true paper, but serviceable
- Grows in wetlands
- Brittle, but can last centuries in dry conditions

**Bamboo** (Good quality if processed well)
- Fast-growing
- Long fibers
- Requires thorough pulping
- Traditional Asian papermaking material

**Other Plant Materials** (Emergency use)
- Straw (wheat, rice, rye)
- Corn stalks
- Reeds and grasses
- Tree bark (inner bark)
- Wasp nests (already partially processed fibers!)

### The Pulping Process

**Goal:** Break plant material down to individual fibers without destroying them.

**Step 1: Preparation (Rags)**
1. Sort materials by color (white, light, dark)
2. Remove buttons, seams, non-fabric materials
3. Cut or tear into 2-inch squares
4. Wash thoroughly to remove dirt and oils
5. If very dirty, boil in water first, rinse, repeat

**Step 1: Preparation (Plant Materials)**
1. Harvest young, green plant material (softer fibers)
2. Remove leaves, separate stems
3. Ret (soak) in water 1-2 weeks to loosen fibers
4. Strip outer bark, keep only inner fibers
5. Chop into 1-2 inch pieces

**Step 2: Cooking (Critical)**
1. Prepare lye solution:
   - Wood ash lye: 1 part ashes to 5 parts water, settled and strained
   - Or caustic soda if available (sodium hydroxide)
   - Or slaked lime (calcium hydroxide)
2. Combine plant material and lye in large pot (not aluminum!)
3. Ratio: 1 part fiber to 10 parts lye solution
4. Boil 2-6 hours (rags need less time than wood)
5. Stir occasionally, add water if needed
6. Fibers should become soft and separate easily
7. Test: Fiber should pull apart with minimal force

**WARNING:** Lye is caustic. Wear gloves. Avoid splashes. Work outdoors or with ventilation.

**Step 3: Washing**
1. Drain lye solution (save for next batch if possible)
2. Rinse fibers thoroughly in clean water
3. Repeat until water runs clear
4. Squeeze out excess water
5. Spread fibers to check for unprocessed material
6. Remove any remaining non-fiber debris

**Step 4: Beating (Most Labor-Intensive)**

**Goal:** Separate fibers and roughen their surfaces so they'll bond together.

**Traditional Method (Stamper/Beater):**
1. Place washed fibers in wooden trough
2. Pound with wooden stamper or hammer
3. Continue for 2-6 hours
4. Water-powered trip hammers greatly speed this process
5. Fibers should become fluffy, well-separated

**Hollander Beater (Better):**
1. Stone or metal cylinder with bars
2. Rotates past bedplate with bars
3. Fibers pass between, get beaten and cut
4. Much faster than stamping
5. Construction: cylinder 12-18" diameter, hand-cranked or water-powered

**Hand Method (Slow):**
1. Place wet fibers in large mortar
2. Pound with wooden pestle
3. Work in small batches
4. 30-60 minutes per batch

**Test for Readiness:**
1. Place small amount in jar of water
2. Shake vigorously
3. Fibers should disperse evenly
4. Should not clump or form lumps
5. Should not be too short (weakens paper)

### Sheet Forming (Mold and Deckle)

**The Mold:**
- Wooden frame with wire screen or laid bamboo
- Screen should be fine enough to hold fibers (20-40 wires per inch)
- Traditional: Parallel wires (laid lines) with perpendicular chain lines
- Simple: Wire window screen (modern shortcut)
- Size: Start with 8"x10" or A4 size
- Must be perfectly flat

**The Deckle:**
- Matching frame that sits on top of mold
- Creates paper edge and controls thickness
- Should fit snugly but removably
- Height: 1/2" to 1" walls

**Building a Mold and Deckle:**

Materials:
- Wood strips 1"x1" for frame
- Wire screening or bamboo strips
- Waterproof glue or nails
- Waterproof finish (varnish, linseed oil)

Construction:
1. Build two identical rectangular frames
2. Stretch wire screen over one frame
3. Secure screen with small nails or staples
4. Screen must be tight and flat
5. Second frame becomes deckle
6. Waterproof all wood surfaces

**The Vat:**
1. Container larger than mold (by 4-6 inches each side)
2. Deep enough to submerge mold completely (6-8 inches)
3. Wood, plastic, or stone (not metal)
4. Should hold steady temperature

**Preparing the Pulp:**
1. Fill vat 2/3 with clean water
2. Add beaten pulp gradually
3. Stir thoroughly
4. Consistency: Thin cream soup
5. Too thick = thick, uneven paper
6. Too thin = weak, thin paper
7. Test: Make a sheet, adjust

**Forming Sheets:**

1. **Stir** the vat vigorously to suspend fibers evenly
2. **Position** deckle on top of mold
3. **Grip** mold and deckle firmly together
4. **Plunge** vertically into vat, well below surface
5. **Level** while still submerged
6. **Lift** straight up with smooth, steady motion
7. **Shake** gently side-to-side then front-to-back
8. **Drain** 10-20 seconds while held level
9. **Remove** deckle carefully
10. **Inspect** sheet for evenness

**Common Problems:**
- Holes: Not enough pulp, disturbed while forming
- Lumps: Insufficient beating, not stirred enough
- Thin spots: Uneven shake, pulled up at angle
- Too thick/thin: Adjust pulp concentration

### Couching (Transferring Wet Sheets)

**Couching Felt:**
- Wool felt or thick cotton fabric
- Must be absorbent
- Slightly larger than paper
- Need multiple pieces (one per sheet)

**The Couching Process:**
1. Prepare wet felt on flat surface
2. Flip mold over onto felt in one motion
3. Press mold down firmly
4. Rock gently to release sheet
5. Lift mold away
6. Sheet should transfer to felt
7. Cover with another felt
8. Repeat with next sheet

**Building a Post:**
- Stack of alternating sheets and felts
- Start with felt on bottom
- Sheet, felt, sheet, felt, etc.
- Top felt, then pressing board

### Pressing

**Goal:** Remove water and bond fibers together.

**Screw Press Method:**
1. Place post between pressing boards
2. Apply pressure gradually
3. Increase over 5-10 minutes
4. Press hard for 10-30 minutes
5. Release pressure gradually
6. Remove post

**Weight Press Method:**
1. Place heavy weights on pressing boards
2. Add weight gradually
3. Leave for several hours
4. Can press overnight

**Rock Press (No Equipment):**
1. Place post on flat surface
2. Cover with board
3. Stand on board, rock weight around
4. Crude but functional

**After Pressing:**
1. Carefully separate sheets from felts
2. Sheets will still be damp
3. Felts can be wrung out and reused

### Drying

**Loft Drying (Best Quality):**
1. Hang sheets individually on lines
2. Use wood clips or pins
3. Good air circulation
4. Protected from direct sun and rain
5. Dry 1-3 days depending on humidity
6. Paper may be wavy when dry

**Board Drying:**
1. Lay sheets flat on wood boards
2. Weight edges to prevent curling
3. Can stack with boards between
4. Change boards if they get too wet
5. Slower but flatter paper

**Press Drying:**
1. Exchange wet felts for dry ones
2. Press again lightly
3. Repeat with dry felts several times
4. Finish with air drying or keep in press

**Final Pressing (Optional):**
1. Once completely dry, stack sheets
2. Press between boards overnight
3. Creates smooth, flat paper
4. Can burnish individual sheets with smooth stone

### Sizing (Making Paper Writable)

Unsized paper is blotting paper - ink will spread and feather. Sizing fills gaps between fibers and creates a surface that holds ink.

**Gelatin Sizing (Best for Permanence):**

Materials:
- Gelatin (from animal hides, bones, hooves)
- Clean water
- Alum (aluminum sulfate) - optional hardener

Process:
1. Soak gelatin in cold water (1 part gelatin to 20 parts water)
2. Heat gently until dissolved (do not boil)
3. Cool to room temperature
4. Add alum if desired (1% of gelatin weight)
5. Submerge paper sheets one at a time
6. Let drain
7. Hang to dry
8. Press when dry

**Starch Sizing (Simpler, Less Permanent):**
1. Cook starch (wheat, rice, corn) in water
2. Ratio: 1 part starch to 50 parts water
3. Stir while heating until clear
4. Cool slightly
5. Dip sheets
6. Dry and press

**Alternative Sizing:**
- Wheat paste (very thin)
- Rice water (traditional Asian method)
- Egg white (expensive, but excellent)
- Plant mucilages (okra, mallow)

**Internal Sizing (Advanced):**
Add rosin and alum to pulp before forming sheets. More complex but more efficient.

## Ink Making

Permanent ink is crucial for lasting records. Two formulas have proven themselves over centuries.

### Carbon Ink (Soot-Based)

**Advantages:**
- Simple to make
- Water-resistant when dry
- Permanent
- Deep black color
- Non-corrosive

**Basic Formula:**

Ingredients:
- Carbon black (lampblack or soot)
- Binder (gum arabic, hide glue, or egg white)
- Water

Collection of Soot:
1. Burn oil in a lamp with low oxygen
2. Hold cool surface over flame
3. Scrape off carbon deposits
4. OR collect from bottom of pots/pans
5. OR burn pine wood in oxygen-poor fire, collect soot
6. Grind carbon to finest possible powder

Production:
1. Mix 1 part carbon with 1 part gum arabic (dry weight)
2. Grind together thoroughly (mortar and pestle)
3. Add water slowly while grinding
4. Continue until smooth, no grittiness
5. Consistency: Heavy cream
6. Strain through fine cloth
7. Store in sealed container

**Gum Arabic Substitute:**
- Hide glue (boiled hide/bone)
- Fish glue
- Tree sap (cherry, acacia)
- Starch paste (weak binder)

**Testing:**
1. Write test line
2. Let dry completely
3. Try to smudge
4. Try water
5. Should be permanent

### Iron Gall Ink (Most Permanent)

**This is the ink of historical documents. Survives centuries.**

**Advantages:**
- Extremely permanent
- Penetrates paper
- Darkens with age
- Nearly impossible to erase
- Water-resistant when cured

**Disadvantages:**
- Can be corrosive to paper if too acidic
- Takes time to darken fully
- More complex to make

**Formula:**

Ingredients:
- Oak galls (or tannic plant material)
- Iron sulfate (ferrous sulfate/copperas)
- Gum arabic
- Water
- Optional: Vinegar or wine (acid)

Oak Galls:
- Round balls on oak trees
- Caused by wasp larvae
- Extremely high in tannic acid
- Alternatives: Chestnut hulls, sumac, gallnuts, strong tea, oak bark

Production:
1. **Make Tannin Extract:**
   - Crush 2 oz oak galls to powder
   - Add 1 cup water (preferably rainwater)
   - Let sit 1-3 days, stirring occasionally
   - Can heat gently to speed extraction
   - Strain out solids

2. **Prepare Iron Solution:**
   - Dissolve 1 oz iron sulfate (copperas) in 1/4 cup water
   - Should dissolve completely

3. **Combine:**
   - Add iron solution to tannin extract slowly
   - Stir constantly
   - Color should turn dark blue-black
   - Add 1/2 oz gum arabic (dissolved in water)
   - Mix thoroughly
   - Optional: Add 1 tablespoon vinegar or wine

4. **Age:**
   - Store in glass or ceramic container
   - Age 1-2 weeks before use
   - Stir daily
   - Strain before use

5. **Adjustment:**
   - Too thin: Add more gum arabic
   - Too pale: Add more iron sulfate
   - Too thick: Add water
   - Smells bad: This is normal (iron sulfate odor)

**Alternative Iron Sources:**
- Rusty nails in vinegar (let sit 1-2 weeks)
- Iron filings in vinegar
- Steel wool in vinegar
- Produces iron acetate (works similarly)

**Testing:**
1. Write on scrap paper
2. Ink appears gray-blue when wet
3. Darkens to black as it oxidizes
4. Full darkness in 1-3 days
5. Should penetrate paper, visible from back

**Warning:** Too much iron sulfate makes ink corrosive. Use minimum amount needed for darkness. Add gum arabic for protection.

### Colored Inks

**Red Ink:**
- Madder root extract + gum arabic
- Red ochre (iron oxide) ground fine + binder
- Brazilwood extract
- Cochineal insects (crushed) + alum mordant

**Blue Ink:**
- Indigo + gum arabic
- Prussian blue (iron ferrocyanide - complex chemistry)
- Woad extract

**Yellow Ink:**
- Turmeric + gum arabic
- Saffron extract
- Safflower

**Green Ink:**
- Verdigris (copper acetate from copper in vinegar)
- Mix blue and yellow inks
- Copper sulfate solution

**General Color Ink Formula:**
1. Grind pigment to finest powder
2. Mix with gum arabic solution
3. Add water to desired consistency
4. Strain well
5. Test permanence before important use

### Ink Storage

- Glass bottles (best)
- Ceramic containers
- Avoid metal (reacts with iron gall ink)
- Cork or wax seal to prevent evaporation
- Label clearly
- Store in cool, dark place
- Ink can last years if sealed
- Add drop of clove oil or thyme oil to prevent mold

## Writing Implements

### Quill Pens (Traditional, Excellent)

**Feather Selection:**
- Goose feathers (most common)
- Swan (luxury, very large)
- Turkey (common, good)
- Crow or raven (fine lines)
- Use primary flight feathers (outer 5)
- Prefer wing feathers over tail
- Left wing for right-handed writers (natural curve)

**Preparation:**

1. **Cleaning:**
   - Strip barbs from lower 2/3 of feather
   - Leave tuft at top for appearance (optional)
   - Wipe shaft clean

2. **Hardening (Curing):**
   - Heat sand in pan until quite hot
   - Plunge feather shaft into hot sand
   - Leave 10-20 seconds
   - Remove and wipe
   - Shaft should be clear, hard, and slightly translucent
   - This process is called "dutching"

3. **Cutting the Nib:**
   - Use very sharp knife
   - Make first cut to remove tip at 45-degree angle
   - Scoop out inner membrane
   - Make slit up center of nib (1/4 inch)
   - Shape nib from underside with two cuts forming point
   - Final cut straight across for writing width
   - Sharpen point carefully

**Nib Shapes:**
- Fine point for small writing
- Broad nib for large letters
- Angled for calligraphy
- Recut as needed (each quill good for many cuts)

**Writing:**
- Dip in ink
- Wipe excess on bottle edge
- Write 10-20 words before re-dipping
- Gentle pressure (quill is flexible)
- Re-cut when nib gets rough

### Brush Pens (Asian Style)

**Construction:**
1. Hair/bristles: Rabbit, goat, wolf, weasel, or horsehair
2. Bundle bristles, tie firmly
3. Insert in hollow bamboo or reed handle
4. Seal with glue or wrap
5. Point should come to fine tip when wet

**Sizes:**
- Fine: 1/8 inch diameter
- Medium: 1/4 inch
- Large: 1/2 inch or more

**Use:**
- Wet brush, load with ink
- Hold vertically
- Pressure controls line width
- Excellent for Asian characters
- Good for large writing

### Pencils (Graphite in Wood)

**Graphite:**
- Natural mineral, soft carbon
- Mines: Cumberland (England) historically
- Can be found in metamorphic rocks
- Alternative: Charcoal (less permanent)

**Production:**

Method 1: Pure Graphite Stick
1. Find or mine graphite
2. Cut into thin sticks
3. Wrap in paper or insert in grooved wood
4. Simple but wastes graphite

Method 2: Graphite/Clay Mix (Modern Method)
1. Grind graphite to powder
2. Mix with clay (ratio determines hardness)
3. More clay = harder pencil
4. Form into thin rods
5. Dry completely
6. Fire in kiln (hardens)
7. Insert in wood casing

**Casing:**
1. Cut wood slat (cedar is traditional)
2. Groove down center with plane or saw
3. Lay graphite in groove
4. Glue second slat on top
5. Let dry
6. Shape into hexagonal or round cross-section
7. Sharpen to point with knife

**Advantages:**
- Doesn't require dipping
- Can be erased (bread crumbs or rubber)
- Good for sketches and temporary writing
- Doesn't fade like some inks

**Disadvantages:**
- Less permanent than ink
- Can smudge
- Graphite may be hard to find

## Printing Press Construction (Gutenberg-Style)

**The printing press revolutionized knowledge. This is your highest priority mechanical project.**

### Screw Press Mechanism

**Basic Principle:**
- Large wooden screw converts rotational motion to linear force
- Platen descends to press paper against inked type
- Even pressure across entire forme
- Similar to wine or olive press

**Materials Needed:**
- Hardwood (oak, maple, beech)
- Large wooden screw (2-3 inch diameter)
- Matching threaded block
- Heavy timbers for frame
- Flat metal or wood platen
- Bed/coffin for type forme
- Rails for moving bed

**Frame Construction:**

1. **Uprights:**
   - Two vertical posts, 6-8 feet tall
   - 6"x6" or larger timber
   - Mortised firmly into base
   - Top beam connecting uprights (hounce)

2. **Base:**
   - Heavy timber platform
   - Must not flex under pressure
   - 4'x3' or larger
   - Mounted on legs or bench

3. **Bed (Coffin):**
   - Flat surface that holds type forme
   - Slides in and out on rails
   - Stone surface ideal (flat, smooth)
   - 18"x24" working size minimum
   - Rails allow precise positioning

**Screw Mechanism:**

1. **Screw:**
   - 2-3 inch diameter, 12-18 inch length
   - Wooden screw (traditional) or metal (if available)
   - Thread pitch: 1/2 inch or coarser
   - Attached to platen at bottom

2. **Making Wooden Screw:**
   - Turn cylinder on lathe
   - Cut spiral groove (thread)
   - Smooth and harden with oil
   - OR carve by hand (very difficult)
   - Metal screw is much better if available

3. **Threaded Block (Nut):**
   - Mounted in hounce (top beam)
   - Wooden block with matching thread
   - OR metal nut
   - Must turn smoothly

4. **Lever (Bar):**
   - Long wooden arm attached to screw top
   - 3-4 feet length
   - Provides leverage for turning
   - Pull lever to lower platen

**Platen:**
- Flat pressing surface
- Attached to bottom of screw
- 12"x18" or larger
- Metal plate or very hard, flat wood
- Must be perfectly parallel to bed

**Operation:**
1. Bed rolls out on rails
2. Type forme is inked
3. Paper is positioned
4. Bed rolls under platen
5. Lever is pulled, lowering platen
6. Pressure applied for 1-2 seconds
7. Lever released, platen rises
8. Bed rolls out
9. Printed sheet removed

**Critical Points:**
- Frame must be absolutely rigid
- Platen must be parallel to bed
- Pressure must be even
- Smooth operation essential for speed

### Type Casting (Making Metal Type)

**Type Metal Alloy:**
- Lead: 60-80%
- Tin: 10-20%
- Antimony: 10-20%

**Why this alloy:**
- Low melting point (250-300C)
- Expands slightly when cooling (fills mold)
- Hard enough to withstand pressing
- Antimony prevents oxidation

**Type Mold (Critical Tool):**

A precision tool with two hinged parts that close to form letter-shaped cavity.

Components:
1. **Body:** Two brass or steel blocks, hinged
2. **Matrix:** Letter shape punched or engraved in copper
3. **Matrix holder:** Slot at bottom of mold
4. Matrix slides in, forms face of letter
5. Cavity above forms body of type

**Making a Matrix:**

Method 1: Punch (Best)
1. Carve letter in reverse on steel punch
2. Harden punch (heat and quench)
3. Strike punch into soft copper blank
4. Creates letter impression
5. File and finish matrix

Method 2: Engraving
1. Engrave letter in reverse into copper
2. More difficult than punching
3. Allows more ornate designs

**Casting Process:**

1. Insert matrix into bottom of mold
2. Close mold firmly
3. Heat type metal in crucible until molten
4. Pour molten metal into mold opening
5. Metal fills cavity, forming type
6. Cool briefly (5-10 seconds)
7. Open mold, remove type
8. Close mold, repeat

**Safety:**
- Molten lead is dangerous
- Work in ventilated area
- Avoid breathing fumes
- Keep water away from molten metal (explodes)
- Wear leather gloves and apron

**Type Characteristics:**

- Height: All type same height (0.918 inches standard)
- Face: Letter surface, in reverse
- Body: Metal block
- Shoulder: Area around letter
- Nick: Groove to help orient type by touch
- Point size: Height of letter (measured in points)

**Production Rate:**
- Skilled caster: 3,000-4,000 pieces per day
- Need multiple copies of common letters
- E, T, A, O needed in quantity

### Composing Stick and Forme

**Composing Stick:**
- Small metal or wood tray
- Adjustable width
- Holds 2-3 lines of type while setting
- Compositor holds in left hand

**Setting Type:**
1. Pick individual letters from case
2. Place in stick from left to right
3. Letters upside down and backwards
4. Add spaces between words (blank type)
5. Fill line to exact width
6. Transfer line to galley (tray)

**Galley:**
- Flat tray with raised edges
- Holds set type before forming

**Forme (Form):**
- Type locked in chase (frame) for printing
- Chase: Metal or wood frame
- Quoins: Expanding wedges that lock type tight
- Furniture: Blank blocks filling space around type

**Building a Forme:**
1. Place type from galley into chase
2. Surround with furniture
3. Insert quoins at edges
4. Tighten quoins (with quoin key)
5. Type must be absolutely tight
6. Test: Press on type, nothing should move
7. Place forme on press bed

### Inking

**Ink Balls (Traditional):**
- Leather pads stuffed with wool or horsehair
- Handle attached
- Two balls used together
- Pounded together to distribute ink evenly
- Then pounded on type

**Ink Roller (Better):**
- Cylinder covered with leather or composition
- Handle or frame for rolling
- Roll in ink, then roll over type
- More even coverage
- Faster

**Inking Process:**
1. Place small amount of ink on ink table
2. Work ink with balls or roller
3. Ink should be tacky, not too thin or thick
4. Apply to type forme with rolling/pounding motion
5. Coverage should be even
6. Not too much (smudges) or too little (faint)

**Ink for Printing:**
- Thicker than writing ink
- Carbon black + linseed oil (boiled)
- Ratio: 1 part carbon to 2-3 parts thick oil
- Grind together thoroughly
- Should be thick paste consistency

### Printing Process

**Setup:**
1. Lock forme in press bed
2. Check that type is level
3. Prepare ink
4. Dampen paper slightly (helps ink adhesion)
5. Prepare tympan (frame that holds paper)

**Tympan:**
- Hinged frame with parchment or cloth stretched over it
- Folds down over type
- Holds paper in position
- Frisket: Second frame with cutouts, prevents smudging

**Printing Sequence:**

1. **Ink the forme:** Roll or beat ink evenly over type
2. **Position paper:** Lay sheet on tympan
3. **Fold tympan down:** Paper now covers type
4. **Roll bed under platen:** Slide bed on rails
5. **Pull bar:** Lower platen with pressure
6. **Hold 1-2 seconds:** Even pressure
7. **Release bar:** Platen rises
8. **Roll bed out:** Back to starting position
9. **Lift tympan:** Reveal printed sheet
10. **Remove sheet:** Hang or lay to dry
11. **Repeat:** Next sheet

**Production Rate:**
- Experienced printer: 200-250 sheets per hour
- Two workers (one inking, one pressing): 300+ per hour
- Both sides printed separately (if needed)

**Common Problems:**
- Uneven impression: Press platen not level, adjust
- Faint printing: More ink or more pressure
- Smudging: Too much ink
- Offset: Ink too wet, sheets touching
- Broken type: Excessive pressure, replace

## Movable Type Organization

### Type Case

**Layout:**
- Wooden tray divided into compartments
- Upper case: Capital letters (hence "uppercase")
- Lower case: Small letters (hence "lowercase")
- Each letter has compartment sized by frequency of use

**Traditional Layout (compositor's case):**
- Most common letters in easy reach
- "e" gets largest compartment (most used in English)
- "z" gets small compartment (rarely used)
- Numbers, punctuation in separate sections

**Compartment Sizes by Frequency:**
Large: e, t, a, o, i, n, s, h, r
Medium: l, d, c, u, m, w, f, g, y, p, b
Small: v, k, j, x, q, z

**Multiple Fonts:**
- Different cases for different typefaces
- Different sizes need different cases
- Label each case clearly

### Setting Type (Composition)

**Skills Required:**
- Reading backwards (type is reversed)
- Speed (practice essential)
- Accuracy (errors multiply)
- Spacing judgment

**Process:**
1. Read manuscript
2. Pick letters from case one at a time
3. Place in composing stick
4. Add spaces between words
5. Justify line (make even length)
6. Transfer to galley when stick full

**Justification:**
- Adding spaces to make line exact width
- Thin spaces for fine adjustment
- Tight lines resist shifting
- Must be uniform across page

**Special Characters:**
- Ligatures: Combined letters (fi, fl)
- Dashes: Em-dash, en-dash
- Spaces: Em-quad, en-quad, thin space
- Leaders: Dots for tables

**Proofreading:**
1. Pull proof (test print)
2. Read carefully against manuscript
3. Mark errors
4. Unlock forme
5. Correct errors
6. Lock up again
7. Pull new proof
8. Repeat until perfect

**Distribution (After Printing):**
1. Unlock forme
2. Pick up type piece by piece
3. Return each to its compartment
4. Keep case organized
5. Clean type occasionally

## Bookbinding

Loose printed sheets must become durable books.

### Folding Signatures

**Signature:** Group of pages printed on single large sheet, then folded.

**Folio:** Sheet folded once = 4 pages
**Quarto:** Sheet folded twice = 8 pages
**Octavo:** Sheet folded three times = 16 pages
**Sextodecimo:** Sheet folded four times = 32 pages

**Folding Process:**
1. Print large sheet with multiple pages

## Alternative Reproduction Methods

When printing press is not available, other methods can multiply copies.

### Carbon Copying

**Principle:** Transfer carbon to back of sheet, then pressure from writing transfers carbon to sheet below.

**Making Carbon Paper:**

Materials:
- Thin paper
- Carbon black or very fine soot
- Wax or oil

Process:
1. Mix carbon with melted wax or oil
2. Apply to one side of thin paper
3. Spread evenly
4. Let dry/cool
5. Wipe excess

**Use:**
1. Place carbon paper between sheets (carbon side down)
2. Write on top sheet with pressure
3. Carbon transfers to bottom sheet
4. Can copy 2-3 sheets at once

**Limitations:**
- Copies are less sharp
- Limited number of copies
- Carbon can smudge

### Mimeograph/Stencil Duplicating

**Principle:** Cut stencil, force ink through holes onto paper.

**Stencil Making:**

Materials:
- Waxed paper or thin fabric coated with wax
- Stylus or typewriter (without ribbon)

Process:
1. Write or type on stencil
2. Pressure breaks wax coating
3. Creates permeable areas

**Printing:**
1. Mount stencil on frame or drum
2. Place paper beneath
3. Apply ink to top of stencil
4. Roller forces ink through stencil
5. Ink transfers to paper

**Advantages:**
- 50-100 copies per stencil
- Much faster than hand copying
- Simpler than printing press

**Disadvantages:**
- Lower quality than printing
- Stencils wear out
- Limited detail

### Hectograph/Gelatin Duplicating

**Principle:** Ink transfers to gelatin, then to paper.

**Gelatin Pad:**
1. Dissolve gelatin in water (very concentrated)
2. Add glycerin (keeps gelatin soft)
3. Pour into flat pan
4. Let set

**Process:**
1. Write with special ink (aniline dye based)
2. While wet, press onto gelatin pad
3. Ink transfers to gelatin
4. Press blank papers onto gelatin
5. Each picks up some ink

**Copies:**
- First few: Very clear
- 20-30: Readable
- 50+: Very faint

**Advantages:**
- No mechanical equipment
- Simple
- Fast for small runs

**Disadvantages:**
- Copies degrade quickly
- Limited number
- Special ink needed

### Photography (If Chemicals Available)

**Photographic reproduction of documents:**

If you can make photographic chemicals (see Photography chapter), you can:
1. Photograph document
2. Make negative
3. Print multiple copies

**Photostat/Contact Printing:**
1. Place document on light-sensitive paper
2. Expose to light
3. Develop
4. Creates negative copy
5. Repeat to make positive

**Advantages:**
- Exact reproduction
- Any document can be copied
- No typesetting needed

**Disadvantages:**
- Requires chemical industry
- Each copy needs processing
- Not as permanent as printing

## Paper Preservation

**Books decay. You must fight this.**

### Causes of Deterioration

**Acid:**
- Wood pulp paper contains lignin
- Oxidizes to acid over time
- Acid breaks down cellulose
- Paper becomes brittle and brown
- Rag paper (cotton/linen) is naturally acid-free

**Light:**
- UV radiation breaks down fibers
- Causes fading and brittleness
- Keep books away from windows

**Humidity:**
- Promotes mold growth
- Causes foxing (brown spots)
- Accelerates acid formation
- Warps and cockles pages

**Pests:**
- Silverfish eat paper
- Bookworms tunnel through
- Mice nest in books
- Cockroaches damage bindings

**Poor Storage:**
- Stacking puts pressure on spines
- Tight shelving damages books
- Sunlight fades covers
- Damp basements promote mold

### Preservation Strategies

**Use Quality Materials:**
- Rag paper over wood pulp
- Iron gall ink (permanent)
- Strong sewing and binding
- Leather or cloth covers

**Control Environment:**
- Temperature: 15-20C (cool)
- Humidity: 30-50% (moderate)
- Darkness: Minimal light exposure
- Cleanliness: Dust promotes deterioration

**Proper Storage:**
- Vertical shelving (like bookstore)
- Books not packed too tight
- Support for large books
- Boxes for fragile items
- No basements or attics (temperature/humidity vary)

**Handling:**
- Clean, dry hands
- Support book spine
- Turn pages carefully
- Don't eat/drink near books
- Use bookmarks, not folding corners

**Pest Control:**
- Cedar shelving (repels insects)
- Regular inspection
- Remove infested items immediately
- Freezing kills insects (if climate allows)

**Deacidification:**
- Alkaline wash can neutralize acid
- Soak pages in magnesium bicarbonate solution
- Raises pH, prevents further degradation
- Only for valuable items (labor-intensive)

**Copying:**
- Make multiple copies of important works
- Distribute widely
- If one decays, others survive
- This is the ultimate preservation

### Recopying Schedule

**Critical documents (this guide):**
- Inspect annually
- Recopy every 50 years
- Maintain 10+ copies in different locations

**Important documents:**
- Inspect every 5 years
- Recopy every 100 years

- Metal for type (scavenge lead, tin)
- Time investment is largest cost

**Operating Costs:**
- Paper materials (renewable)
- Ink materials (ongoing)
- Type metal (recyclable)
- Labor
- Facility

**Revenue:**
- Printed books
- Newspapers/bulletins
- Official documents
- Commercial printing
- Education materials

**Pricing:**
- Books: Charge by page count and quantity
- Small run (10 copies): High per-copy cost
- Large run (1000 copies): Low per-copy cost
- Amortize typesetting over whole run

**Priority:**
In early rebuilding, profit is not the goal. The goal is knowledge preservation and dissemination. Once society stabilizes, printing becomes sustainable business.

### Quality Standards

**Humanities and culture:**

- Literature (morale matters)
- History
- Philosophy
- Arts and music

**Why fifth:**
- Not immediately survival-critical
- But necessary for civilization
- Morale and hope matter
- "Man does not live by bread alone"

### Distribution Strategy

**Geographic Dispersal:**
- Never keep all copies in one place
- Minimum 100 miles between major caches
- Different climate zones (fire/flood protection)
- Different political regions (war protection)

**Institutional Placement:**
- Schools (will use and maintain)
- Libraries (traditional keepers)
- Religious institutions (historically stable)
- Government (if trustworthy)
- Trade centers (wide distribution)

**Multiple Formats:**
- Print on best available paper
- If possible, create microfilm (very compact)
- Create abbreviated versions (quicker to copy)
- Illustrated summaries (for wider accessibility)

**Verification:**
- Send someone to verify copies exist
- Annual check-in system
- Replace missing/damaged copies immediately

## Final Critical Instructions

**You, the reader of this chapter, now have the knowledge to:**

1. Make paper from plant fibers
2. Create permanent ink
3. Build writing implements
4. Construct a printing press
5. Cast metal type
6. Print hundreds of copies
7. Bind books that will last centuries
8. Preserve knowledge for future generations

**Your duty is clear:**

**COPY THIS GUIDE.**

Do not wait. Do not assume someone else will do it. Do not assume printed copies exist elsewhere. Every day without copies is a day where human knowledge is one disaster away from extinction.

Start with paper. Even crude paper is better than none. Make ink from soot and glue if you must. Carve wooden type if you cannot cast metal. Hand-copy if you have no other option.

But COPY THIS GUIDE.

Distribute copies. Teach others to make paper and print. Establish print shops in every community. Make knowledge preservation your civilization's highest non-survival priority.

Books can outlive empires. The knowledge in this guide can rebuild civilization. But only if it survives.

The future is in your hands. Literally. These pages, this information, these techniques.

Copy them. Preserve them. Spread them.

Humanity is counting on you.
