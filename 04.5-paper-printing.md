# 04.5 Paper and Printing

## Critical Priority Warning

**THIS GUIDE MUST BE COPIED IMMEDIATELY**

You are reading knowledge that could save civilization. Paper decays. Books burn. Digital storage fails without electricity. The only way to preserve this information is to reproduce it on durable paper with permanent ink and distribute copies widely.

If you have found this guide, your first technological priority after securing food, water, and shelter is to establish paper and printing production. Every month without copies is a month where fire, flood, or simple deterioration could destroy humanity's accumulated knowledge.

**A civilization with printing can rebuild. A civilization without it will forget.**

## Why Paper and Printing Matter

In the pre-digital age, paper and printing were the foundation of knowledge preservation and advancement. A single printing press can produce hundreds of book copies in the time it would take to hand-copy one. This technology:

- Preserves knowledge across generations
- Enables widespread education
- Standardizes technical information
- Allows rapid dissemination of discoveries
- Creates redundancy against knowledge loss
- Facilitates commerce and organization
- Provides permanent records

Books printed on quality rag paper with iron gall ink have survived 500+ years. The Gutenberg Bible, printed in 1455, remains readable today. Digital storage requires continuous power and technology chains. Paper requires only light and dry conditions.

**Your mission: Print this guide. Print it again. Distribute it everywhere.**

**Chapter Dependencies and Cross-References:**

This chapter provides critical knowledge preservation infrastructure. For complete implementation, reference:

**Dependencies (Read These First):**
- **Chapter 0.7: Libraries and Knowledge Preservation** — Broader context for why copying this guide matters
- **Chapter 2: Metalworking** — Press construction, type mold fabrication, tools
- **Chapter 2.7: Standardization** — Type-high specification (0.918"), measurement tools
- **Chapter 4: Essential Chemistry** — Lye production, sizing chemicals (alum), acids for etching

**Related Techniques:**
- **Chapter 2.8: Lubricants and Seals** — Press maintenance, greasing mechanisms
- **Chapter 3: Electricity** — Not required, but can power mechanical beaters if available
- **Chapter 3.5: Medicine** (if available) — Safety note: Lead type metal is toxic, handle with care

**Complementary Skills:**
- **Chapter 03.7: Transportation** — Distributing printed materials to other communities
- **Chapter 1: Salvaging** — Salvage rags, metal for type, paper stock, press components

**Key Points:**
- You can make paper without metallurgy (wooden molds, simple press)
- You can print without metal type (wooden blocks, carved letters)
- **Start with paper production first** - it's the most critical and most achievable
- Printing enhances paper's value but isn't strictly required (hand-copying works)

Whenever this chapter references "see Chapter X," treat it as essential reading for that technique.

## Paper Production from Plant Fibers

Paper is felted plant fibers, suspended in water, then pressed and dried into sheets. Almost any plant material can make paper, though some are far better than others.

### Suitable Materials (Ranked by Quality)

**Cotton and Linen Rags** (Best quality, 500+ year lifespan)
- Old clothes, sheets, sails
- Already processed fibers
- Makes strongest, most durable paper
- This is what you want for permanent records

**Hemp** (Excellent quality, very strong)
- Fast-growing crop
- Long, strong fibers
- Makes durable paper
- Easy to cultivate

**Flax** (Excellent quality)
- Same plant that makes linen
- Very long fibers
- Smooth, fine paper
- Good for detailed printing

**Wood Pulp** (Moderate quality, 50-100 year lifespan)
- Most abundant material
- Softwoods (pine, spruce) have longer fibers than hardwoods
- Requires more processing
- Contains lignin which causes yellowing and brittleness
- Acceptable for temporary documents

**Papyrus** (Ancient Egyptian method)
- Pith of papyrus reed, laid crosswise and pressed
- Not true paper, but serviceable
- Grows in wetlands
- Brittle, but can last centuries in dry conditions

**Bamboo** (Good quality if processed well)
- Fast-growing
- Long fibers
- Requires thorough pulping
- Traditional Asian papermaking material

**Other Plant Materials** (Emergency use)
- Straw (wheat, rice, rye)
- Corn stalks
- Reeds and grasses
- Tree bark (inner bark)
- Wasp nests (already partially processed fibers!)

### The Pulping Process

**Goal:** Break plant material down to individual fibers without destroying them.

**Step 1: Preparation (Rags)**
1. Sort materials by color (white, light, dark)
2. Remove buttons, seams, non-fabric materials
3. Cut or tear into 2-inch squares
4. Wash thoroughly to remove dirt and oils
5. If very dirty, boil in water first, rinse, repeat

**Step 1: Preparation (Plant Materials)**
1. Harvest young, green plant material (softer fibers)
2. Remove leaves, separate stems
3. Ret (soak) in water 1-2 weeks to loosen fibers
4. Strip outer bark, keep only inner fibers
5. Chop into 1-2 inch pieces

**Step 2: Cooking (Critical)**
1. Prepare lye solution:
   - **Wood ash lye**: 1 part ashes to 5 parts water, settled and strained
     - Note: This ratio produces relatively weak lye (suitable starting point)
     - **Testing lye strength**: Dip fingers briefly - should feel slippery/soapy (that's the lye dissolving skin oils)
     - **If too weak** (doesn't feel slippery): Use less water (1:3 or 1:4 ratio) or use stronger ashes
     - **If too strong** (burns skin immediately): Dilute with more water
     - Hardwood ashes (oak, maple) produce stronger lye than softwood
   - Or **caustic soda** if available (sodium hydroxide) - much stronger, use 1-2 tablespoons per gallon water
   - Or **slaked lime** (calcium hydroxide) - weaker than caustic soda, use 1/4 cup per gallon
2. Combine plant material and lye in large pot (not aluminum!)
3. Ratio: 1 part fiber to 10 parts lye solution
4. Boil 2-6 hours (rags need less time than wood)
5. Stir occasionally, add water if needed
6. Fibers should become soft and separate easily
7. Test: Fiber should pull apart with minimal force

**WARNING:** Lye is caustic. Wear gloves. Avoid splashes. Work outdoors or with ventilation.

**Step 3: Washing**
1. Drain lye solution (save for next batch if possible)
2. Rinse fibers thoroughly in clean water
3. Repeat until water runs clear
4. Squeeze out excess water
5. Spread fibers to check for unprocessed material
6. Remove any remaining non-fiber debris

**Step 4: Beating (Most Labor-Intensive)**

**Goal:** Separate fibers and roughen their surfaces so they'll bond together.

**Traditional Method (Stamper/Beater):**
1. Place washed fibers in wooden trough
2. Pound with wooden stamper or hammer
3. Continue for 2-6 hours
4. Water-powered trip hammers greatly speed this process
5. Fibers should become fluffy, well-separated

**Hollander Beater (Better):**
1. Stone or metal cylinder with bars
2. Rotates past bedplate with bars
3. Fibers pass between, get beaten and cut
4. Much faster than stamping
5. Construction: cylinder 12-18" diameter, hand-cranked or water-powered

**Bar Pattern Details (Critical for Beater Performance):**

The pattern and angle of bars on both the roll and bedplate determine beating effectiveness.

**Roll Bars:**
- **Number**: 24-40 bars around circumference (more bars = finer beating, slower)
- **Material**: Hardwood, bronze, or steel (steel lasts longest)
- **Spacing**: 1/2" to 1" apart
- **Height**: Protrude 1/4" to 1/2" from roll surface
- **Angle**: Bars angled 15-20° from perpendicular (spiral pattern)
  - Angle causes cutting action as fibers pass
  - Straight bars (0°) = more tearing, less cutting
  - Too steep angle (>30°) = fibers pushed sideways, not beaten

**Bedplate Bars:**
- **Number**: Should match or slightly exceed roll bars
- **Material**: Same as roll
- **Spacing**: Matches roll bar spacing
- **Angle**: 0° (straight across) OR slight opposite angle to roll (counter-spiral)
  - Straight bedplate bars common
  - Counter-spiral creates shearing action

**Gap Between Roll and Bedplate:**
- **Wide gap** (1/8" to 1/4"): Light beating, minimal fiber cutting
  - Use for initial beating or when you want longer fibers
- **Narrow gap** (1/32" to 1/16"): Heavy beating, more fiber cutting
  - Use for final beating, shorter fibers, smoother paper
  - Too narrow: Jams, excessive fiber damage
- **Adjustable**: Best if gap is adjustable via screw mechanism
  - Start wide, narrow gradually as beating progresses

**Effect of Bar Pattern:**

- **Many bars, narrow gap, steep angle**: Heavy beating, short fibers, smooth paper, slow
- **Few bars, wide gap, shallow angle**: Light beating, long fibers, rough paper, fast
- **Optimize for your needs**: Book paper vs. wrapping paper

**Maintenance:**
- Bars wear down over time (especially wood)
- Replace or re-cut bars when rounded/worn
- Keep gap consistent (check with feeler gauge if available)

**Hand Method (Slow):**
1. Place wet fibers in large mortar
2. Pound with wooden pestle
3. Work in small batches
4. 30-60 minutes per batch

**Beating Degree and Freeness (Critical for Paper Quality):**

"Beating degree" describes how much the fibers have been processed. "Freeness" is how quickly water drains from the pulp - a practical measure of beating progress.

**Under-Beaten (Insufficient Processing):**
- **Signs:**
  - Fibers clump together in water
  - Lumpy, uneven pulp
  - Fibers look long and intact
  - Water drains very fast (high freeness)
- **Result:** Weak, uneven paper with holes
- **Fix:** Beat longer

**Properly Beaten (Ideal):**
- **Signs:**
  - Fibers disperse evenly in water
  - No clumps or lumps
  - Milky, uniform suspension
  - Water drains moderately (medium freeness)
  - Fibers look slightly frayed but not destroyed
- **Result:** Strong, even paper with good formation
- **This is your target**

**Over-Beaten (Excessive Processing):**
- **Signs:**
  - Fibers too short or broken apart
  - Very slimy, gel-like pulp
  - Water drains very slowly (low freeness)
  - Difficult to form sheets (won't release from mold easily)
- **Result:** Weak paper (short fibers), slow production, brittle when dry
- **Fix:** Add fresh (under-beaten) pulp to mixture, blend

**Testing Beating Progress:**

**Visual Test (Simple):**
1. Place small handful of pulp in clear jar
2. Fill with water, shake vigorously
3. Observe:
   - **Under-beaten**: Fibers clump, settle quickly, water clear
   - **Good**: Fibers suspend evenly, milky appearance, slow settling
   - **Over-beaten**: Gel-like, very cloudy, barely any settling

**Drainage Test (Freeness):**
1. Take handful of pulp in your hand
2. Squeeze water out
3. Observe drainage:
   - **Fast drainage** (water runs out immediately): Under-beaten, keep beating
   - **Moderate drainage** (water flows but slowly): Good, ready to use
   - **Very slow drainage** (water barely comes out, slimy): Over-beaten, dilute or start over

**Sheet Test (Most Accurate):**
1. Make small test sheet on mold
2. Evaluate when dry:
   - **Weak, tears easily, holes**: Under-beaten
   - **Strong, even, holds together**: Good
   - **Brittle, hard, surface sheen**: Over-beaten

**Beating Time Guidelines:**

Typical beating times (will vary by method and material):

- **Rags (cotton/linen)**: 2-4 hours (Hollander beater), 4-8 hours (stamper)
- **Paper pulp (recycled paper)**: 30 min-2 hours (already processed once)
- **Bast fibers (hemp, flax)**: 3-6 hours
- **Wood pulp**: 4-10 hours (if starting from cooked wood chips)

**Factors affecting time:**
- Material type (soft rags beat faster than wood)
- Cooking thoroughness (well-cooked material beats faster)
- Beating method (Hollander faster than stamping)
- Desired paper quality (book paper needs more beating than wrapping paper)

**Adjusting for Different Paper Types:**

**Writing/Printing Paper:**
- Medium-high beating
- Good fiber bonding needed
- Smooth surface for ink

**Strong Wrapping Paper:**
- Low-medium beating
- Longer fibers = more tear strength
- Smoothness less important

**Blotting Paper:**
- Low beating
- Need high freeness (fast drainage)
- Minimal fiber bonding = absorbent

**Beating Multiple Batches:**

- Keep notes on beating time for each material type
- Consistency matters for even paper quality
- Can blend batches (mix under-beaten with over-beaten)
- Experienced papermakers learn to judge by feel and sound

**Pro Tip:**
Better to slightly under-beat than over-beat. You can always beat more. You cannot "un-beat" over-processed pulp except by adding fresh material.

### Sheet Forming (Mold and Deckle)

**The Mold:**
- Wooden frame with wire screen or laid bamboo
- Screen should be fine enough to hold fibers (20-40 wires per inch)
- Traditional: Parallel wires (laid lines) with perpendicular chain lines
- Simple: Wire window screen (modern shortcut)
- Size: Start with 8"x10" or A4 size
- Must be perfectly flat

**The Deckle:**
- Matching frame that sits on top of mold
- Creates paper edge and controls thickness
- Should fit snugly but removably
- Height: 1/2" to 1" walls

**Building a Mold and Deckle:**

Materials:
- Wood strips 1"x1" for frame
- Wire screening or bamboo strips
- Waterproof glue or nails
- Waterproof finish (varnish, linseed oil)

Construction:
1. Build two identical rectangular frames
2. Stretch wire screen over one frame
3. Secure screen with small nails or staples
4. Screen must be tight and flat
5. Second frame becomes deckle
6. Waterproof all wood surfaces

### Watermarks (Optional but Valuable)

**What Is a Watermark:**
- Translucent design visible when paper is held to light
- Created by varying paper thickness during formation
- Used for: Authentication, identification, decoration, dating

**How Watermarks Work:**
- Raised wire design attached to mold surface
- Where wire is raised, less pulp settles → thinner paper → lighter (translucent) when backlit
- Where wire is depressed, more pulp settles → thicker paper → darker when backlit

**Creating a Watermark Design:**

**Simple Wire Watermark:**
1. **Design**: Keep it simple (initials, date, symbol)
   - Maximum detail: About 1/8" wire spacing
   - Curves easier than sharp angles
2. **Material**: Fine wire (20-24 gauge copper or brass)
   - Must not rust (copper, brass, stainless steel)
3. **Construction**:
   - Bend wire into desired shape
   - Sew wire to mold screen with fine wire stitches
   - Wire should stand ~1/16" above screen surface
   - Secure at multiple points so it doesn't move
4. **Location**: Usually center or corner of mold

**Examples:**
- **Initials**: "JD" or "AB" (your community's mark)
- **Date**: "2087" (year of production)
- **Symbol**: Simple cross, star, circle
- **Community mark**: Unique symbol identifying your print shop

**Testing:**
1. Make test sheet with watermark mold
2. Hold to light when dry
3. Design should be visible as lighter area
4. If invisible: Wire not raised enough
5. If too bold: Wire too high or too thick

**Why Watermarks Matter:**
- **Authentication**: Proves paper from your shop (important for official documents)
- **Dating**: Future historians will thank you
- **Quality signal**: Watermarks indicate careful craftsmanship
- **Identification**: If papers get separated, watermark identifies source

**Historical Note:**
Medieval and Renaissance paper makers used watermarks extensively. Museums can date old manuscripts by watermark patterns. Your watermarks will help future historians understand your era.

**The Vat:**
1. Container larger than mold (by 4-6 inches each side)
2. Deep enough to submerge mold completely (6-8 inches)
3. Wood, plastic, or stone (not metal)
4. Should hold steady temperature

**Preparing the Pulp:**
1. Fill vat 2/3 with clean water
2. Add beaten pulp gradually
3. Stir thoroughly
4. Consistency: Thin cream soup
5. Too thick = thick, uneven paper
6. Too thin = weak, thin paper
7. Test: Make a sheet, adjust

**Forming Sheets:**

1. **Stir** the vat vigorously to suspend fibers evenly
2. **Position** deckle on top of mold
3. **Grip** mold and deckle firmly together
4. **Plunge** vertically into vat, well below surface
5. **Level** while still submerged
6. **Lift** straight up with smooth, steady motion
7. **Shake** gently side-to-side then front-to-back
8. **Drain** 10-20 seconds while held level
9. **Remove** deckle carefully
10. **Inspect** sheet for evenness

**Common Problems:**
- Holes: Not enough pulp, disturbed while forming
- Lumps: Insufficient beating, not stirred enough
- Thin spots: Uneven shake, pulled up at angle
- Too thick/thin: Adjust pulp concentration

### Couching (Transferring Wet Sheets)

**Couching Felt:**
- Wool felt or thick cotton fabric
- Must be absorbent
- Slightly larger than paper
- Need multiple pieces (one per sheet)

**The Couching Process:**
1. Prepare wet felt on flat surface
2. Flip mold over onto felt in one motion
3. Press mold down firmly
4. Rock gently to release sheet
5. Lift mold away
6. Sheet should transfer to felt
7. Cover with another felt
8. Repeat with next sheet

**Building a Post:**
- Stack of alternating sheets and felts
- Start with felt on bottom
- Sheet, felt, sheet, felt, etc.
- Top felt, then pressing board

### Pressing

**Goal:** Remove water and bond fibers together.

**Screw Press Method:**
1. Place post between pressing boards
2. Apply pressure gradually
3. Increase over 5-10 minutes
4. Press hard for 10-30 minutes
5. Release pressure gradually
6. Remove post

**Weight Press Method:**
1. Place heavy weights on pressing boards
2. Add weight gradually
3. Leave for several hours
4. Can press overnight

**Rock Press (No Equipment):**
1. Place post on flat surface
2. Cover with board
3. Stand on board, rock weight around
4. Crude but functional

**After Pressing:**
1. Carefully separate sheets from felts
2. Sheets will still be damp
3. Felts can be wrung out and reused

### Drying

**Loft Drying (Best Quality):**

Best method for preserving paper quality. Sheets dry naturally with air circulation.

**Drying Loft Construction:**

**Location:**
- Upper floor or attic (heat rises, aids drying)
- Protected from weather (roof, walls)
- Windows or vents for air circulation (cross-breeze ideal)
- Dry environment (not damp basement)

**Basic Line System:**

1. **Horizontal Lines:**
   - String heavy cord or wire across room
   - Spacing: 12-18 inches apart (allows air flow between sheets)
   - Height: Above head height (maximize space, keep floor clear)
   - Multiple tiers possible (6-8 feet vertical spacing between tiers)
   - Tension: Tight (prevents sagging, sheets touching)

2. **Line Material:**
   - Hemp rope (traditional, strong, doesn't rot easily)
   - Nylon cord (modern salvage, excellent)
   - Wire (galvanized or stainless, won't rust onto paper)
   - Avoid: Cotton string (stretches, may rot), rusty wire

3. **Attachment:**
   - Anchor to wall studs or ceiling joists (strong - wet paper is heavy)
   - Eye-bolts or hooks screwed into beams
   - Tension with turnbuckles or tightening wraps

**Hanging Methods:**

**Wood Clips:**
- Clothespins work (traditional)
- Clip top edge of sheet
- One clip every 6-8 inches prevents drooping
- Smooth clips (no rough edges that tear paper)

**Split-Cane Method (Traditional):**
- Split bamboo or thin wood strips
- Spring tension holds paper
- Gentler on paper than hard clips
- Can make from salvaged materials

**Pin Method:**
- Small brass or stainless pins through edge
- Hangs sheet from line
- Doesn't leave clip marks
- More fiddly but elegant

**Drying Process:**

1. **Hang sheets individually:**
   - Don't overlap (won't dry properly)
   - Don't crowd (need air circulation)
   - Clip/pin top edge only (gravity pulls flat)

2. **Air circulation:**
   - Open windows on opposite sides (cross-breeze)
   - Don't use forced heat (warps paper)
   - Avoid direct sunlight (yellows paper, uneven drying)

3. **Drying time:**
   - 1-3 days depending on:
     - Humidity (longer in damp weather)
     - Air flow (faster with good ventilation)
     - Paper thickness (thick paper takes longer)
     - Temperature (warm air holds more moisture)

4. **Check for dryness:**
   - Should feel dry to touch
   - No cold spots (indicates moisture)
   - Edges dry first, center last
   - When fully dry, may be slightly wavy (normal)

**Capacity:**

Estimate lines needed:
- Each line: ~20-40 sheets depending on length
- 10 lines: 200-400 sheets drying at once
- For production papermaking: Plan for 500-1000 sheet capacity

**Example Loft Setup (10'x20' room):**
- 8 lines running 18-foot length
- Spaced 15 inches apart
- ~30 sheets per line = 240 sheets capacity
- Change-out every 2-3 days = ~80-120 sheets/day production

**Drying Rack Frames (Alternative):**

For smaller operations or when loft space unavailable:

**Frame Construction:**
1. Build wooden frame: 4'x6' rectangular
2. String horizontal lines across frame (6-10 lines)
3. Space lines 6-8 inches apart
4. Lean frame against wall or hang from ceiling
5. Multiple frames can be used in series

**Advantages:**
- Portable
- Can be brought outdoors in good weather
- Can be angled for better drainage
- Easy to construct

**Disadvantages:**
- Lower capacity than full loft
- Takes floor space

**Board Drying:**
1. Lay sheets flat on wood boards
2. Weight edges to prevent curling
3. Can stack with boards between
4. Change boards if they get too wet
5. Slower but flatter paper

**Press Drying:**
1. Exchange wet felts for dry ones
2. Press again lightly
3. Repeat with dry felts several times
4. Finish with air drying or keep in press

**Final Pressing (Optional):**
1. Once completely dry, stack sheets
2. Press between boards overnight
3. Creates smooth, flat paper
4. Can burnish individual sheets with smooth stone

### Sizing (Making Paper Writable)

Unsized paper is blotting paper - ink will spread and feather. Sizing fills gaps between fibers and creates a surface that holds ink.

**Gelatin Sizing (Best for Permanence):**

Materials:
- Gelatin (from animal hides, bones, hooves)
- Clean water
- Alum (aluminum sulfate) - optional hardener

Process:
1. Soak gelatin in cold water (1 part gelatin to 20 parts water)
2. Heat gently until dissolved (do not boil)
3. Cool to room temperature
4. Add alum if desired (1% of gelatin weight)
5. Submerge paper sheets one at a time
6. Let drain
7. Hang to dry
8. Press when dry

**Starch Sizing (Simpler, Less Permanent):**
1. Cook starch (wheat, rice, corn) in water
2. Ratio: 1 part starch to 50 parts water
3. Stir while heating until clear
4. Cool slightly
5. Dip sheets
6. Dry and press

**Alternative Sizing:**
- Wheat paste (very thin)
- Rice water (traditional Asian method)
- Egg white (expensive, but excellent)
- Plant mucilages (okra, mallow)

**Internal Sizing (Advanced):**

Internal sizing means adding sizing agent to the pulp before forming sheets, rather than dipping finished paper afterward. This is more efficient and produces more uniform results.

**Rosin Sizing (Most Common Internal Sizing):**

**Why Rosin:**
- Rosin (pine resin) is naturally water-repellent
- Abundant from pine trees
- Creates durable sizing
- Historical standard for paper mills

**Materials:**
- **Rosin** (pine resin/colophony)
  - Collect from pine trees (sap)
  - Or distill from pine wood stumps
  - Purify by melting and straining
- **Alum** (aluminum sulfate, AlSO₄)
  - See Chapter 4 for alum production
  - Critical: Alum makes rosin stick to fibers
- **Caustic soda** (sodium hydroxide, lye)
  - For making rosin soap

**Rosin Soap Preparation:**
1. **Make rosin soap** (emulsifies rosin in water):
   - Heat 100g rosin gently until melted
   - In separate container, dissolve 15g caustic soda in 200ml water (CAREFULLY - exothermic)
   - Slowly add hot rosin to caustic soda solution while stirring vigorously
   - Rosin will emulsify into milky soap solution
   - This is rosin size stock solution
2. **Store** in sealed container (stable for weeks)

**Sizing the Pulp:**
1. **Prepare pulp** as normal (beaten, in vat)
2. **Add rosin soap** to pulp:
   - Ratio: 2-3% rosin by dry weight of fiber
   - For 100g dry fiber: Use soap made from 2-3g rosin
   - Stir thoroughly into pulp
3. **Add alum solution**:
   - Ratio: 3-5% alum by dry weight of fiber
   - Dissolve alum in warm water first
   - Add to pulp while stirring
   - Alum precipitates rosin onto fibers (you'll see pulp change slightly)
   - **Critical:** Add alum AFTER rosin, not before
4. **Wait 5-10 minutes** for rosin to fix to fibers
5. **Form sheets** as normal
6. **Dry** - rosin sizing is already in the paper

**Why This Works:**
- Rosin soap is alkaline and water-soluble
- Alum (acidic) reacts with rosin soap
- Precipitates rosin as tiny particles on fiber surfaces
- Creates water-resistant coating inside paper structure

**Advantages Over External Sizing:**
- More uniform (every fiber sized)
- More efficient (less material waste)
- Sized throughout thickness (not just surface)
- Faster (no separate dipping step)

**Disadvantages:**
- More chemistry knowledge required
- Must get proportions right
- Alum slightly acidic (can cause paper aging issues over centuries)

**Testing Sized Paper:**
- Drop water on surface
- Well-sized: Water beads up, doesn't absorb immediately
- Unsized: Water soaks in instantly (blotting paper)
- Properly sized paper: Ink doesn't feather or bleed

**Historical Note:**
Rosin-alum sizing became the standard in 19th-century paper mills and remained so until neutral sizing methods were developed. Billions of books were printed on rosin-sized paper. The slight acidity causes "slow fire" aging in libraries, but for post-collapse purposes, rosin sizing is entirely adequate and superior to no sizing.

## Paper Testing and Quality Control

Test paper quality to ensure it will serve its purpose and last. Different uses require different quality levels.

### Physical Strength Tests

**Tear Test (Most Important):**
1. Cut small strip of paper (1" x 6")
2. Hold ends, pull steadily
3. **Good paper**: Tears with significant resistance, shows fibrous edge
4. **Weak paper**: Tears easily, clean edge (under-beaten or wrong material)
5. **Brittle paper**: Snaps rather than tears (over-beaten or too much sizing)

**Fold Test (Durability):**
1. Fold paper sharply, crease with fingernail
2. Unfold
3. Fold same crease 5-10 times
4. **Good paper**: No cracking or breaking at fold
5. **Poor paper**: Cracks or breaks at fold line (brittle, low quality)

**Tensile Strength (For Important Documents):**
1. Suspend weight from strip
2. Gradually increase weight until paper tears
3. **Adequate**: 8-10 lbs per inch width minimum for book paper
4. **Good**: 15-20 lbs per inch width
5. **Excellent**: 25+ lbs per inch width

### Surface Quality Tests

**Sizing Test (Water Resistance):**
1. Drop water onto paper surface
2. Observe:
   - **Well-sized**: Water beads up, doesn't absorb immediately (5+ seconds)
   - **Moderately sized**: Water slowly soaks in (2-5 seconds)
   - **Unsized**: Water soaks in instantly (blotting paper)
3. For writing paper: Needs moderate to good sizing
4. For printing: Good sizing preferred

**Ink Feathering Test:**
1. Draw line with pen/quill
2. Examine edges:
   - **Sharp, clean line**: Good sizing
   - **Fuzzy, spreading edges**: Poor sizing or too absorbent
   - **Ink sits on surface, doesn't dry**: Too much sizing

**Surface Smoothness:**
1. Visual: Hold to light at angle
   - Smooth surface reflects evenly
   - Rough surface shows texture/variation
2. Touch: Run fingertips across
   - Smooth = good for fine printing
   - Rough = acceptable for general use, poor for small type
3. Magnification (if available):
   - Should see individual fibers but evenly distributed
   - Clumps or holes = quality problem

### Formation Tests

**Light Table Test (Evenness):**
1. Hold sheet to light (window or lamp behind)
2. Look for:
   - **Good formation**: Even translucency, no thick/thin spots
   - **Poor formation**: Clouds, streaks, holes visible
   - **Watermark**: Should be intentional, crisp (if present)

**Thickness Test:**
1. Stack 10 identical sheets
2. Measure total thickness with calipers (or compare to known standard)
3. **Consistent**: All sheets ~same thickness
4. **Variable**: Thickness varies = inconsistent process

### Permanence and Aging Tests

**pH Test (Acidity/Alkalinity):**

Without modern pH strips:
- **Litmus test**: Red cabbage juice (turns pink in acid, green in alkaline)
- **Neutral paper**: Slightly pink to purple (slightly acidic acceptable)
- **Highly acidic**: Bright pink (will age poorly, become brittle over decades)
- **Alkaline**: Green (good for archival purposes)

**Accelerated Aging Test (Optional, For Critical Documents):**
1. Place sample in oven at 100°C (212°F) for 72 hours
2. OR expose to sunlight for 7 days continuously
3. Test strength and flexibility after
4. **Good paper**: Minimal change in strength/flexibility
5. **Poor paper**: Significant yellowing, brittleness

### Color and Brightness

**Whiteness:**
- **Pure white**: Premium quality (hard to achieve without bleaching)
- **Cream/off-white**: Normal for rag paper (perfectly acceptable)
- **Gray**: Acceptable for general use, less attractive
- **Brown**: Recycled paper or plant fibers (functional but lower quality appearance)

**Color uniformity:**
- Should be consistent across sheet
- Streaks or patches indicate processing problems

### Specific Use Testing

**For Printing:**
- [ ] Good sizing (ink doesn't feather)
- [ ] Smooth surface (clean impression)
- [ ] Adequate thickness (doesn't show through)
- [ ] Strong enough (withstands press pressure)

**For Writing:**
- [ ] Moderate sizing (ink dries, doesn't spread)

## Ink Making

Permanent ink is crucial for lasting records. Two formulas have proven themselves over centuries.

### Carbon Ink (Soot-Based)

**Advantages:**
- Simple to make
- Water-resistant when dry
- Permanent
- Deep black color
- Non-corrosive

**Basic Formula:**

Ingredients:
- Carbon black (lampblack or soot)
- Binder (gum arabic, hide glue, or egg white)
- Water

Collection of Soot:
1. Burn oil in a lamp with low oxygen
2. Hold cool surface over flame
3. Scrape off carbon deposits
4. OR collect from bottom of pots/pans
5. OR burn pine wood in oxygen-poor fire, collect soot
6. Grind carbon to finest possible powder

Production:
1. Mix 1 part carbon with 1 part gum arabic (dry weight)
2. Grind together thoroughly (mortar and pestle)
3. Add water slowly while grinding
4. Continue until smooth, no grittiness
5. Consistency: Heavy cream
6. Strain through fine cloth
7. Store in sealed container

**Gum Arabic Substitute:**
- Hide glue (boiled hide/bone)
- Fish glue
- Tree sap (cherry, acacia)
- Starch paste (weak binder)

**Testing:**
1. Write test line
2. Let dry completely
3. Try to smudge
4. Try water
5. Should be permanent

### Iron Gall Ink (Most Permanent)

**This is the ink of historical documents. Survives centuries.**

**Advantages:**
- Extremely permanent
- Penetrates paper
- Darkens with age
- Nearly impossible to erase
- Water-resistant when cured

**Disadvantages:**
- Can be corrosive to paper if too acidic
- Takes time to darken fully
- More complex to make

**Formula:**

Ingredients:
- Oak galls (or tannic plant material)
- Iron sulfate (ferrous sulfate/copperas)
- Gum arabic
- Water
- Optional: Vinegar or wine (acid)

Oak Galls:
- Round balls on oak trees
- Caused by wasp larvae
- Extremely high in tannic acid
- Alternatives: Chestnut hulls, sumac, gallnuts, strong tea, oak bark

Production:
1. **Make Tannin Extract:**
   - Crush 2 oz oak galls to powder
   - Add 1 cup water (preferably rainwater)
   - Let sit 1-3 days, stirring occasionally
   - Can heat gently to speed extraction
   - Strain out solids

2. **Prepare Iron Solution:**
   - Dissolve 1 oz iron sulfate (copperas) in 1/4 cup water
   - Should dissolve completely

3. **Combine:**
   - Add iron solution to tannin extract slowly
   - Stir constantly
   - Color should turn dark blue-black
   - Add 1/2 oz gum arabic (dissolved in water)
   - Mix thoroughly
   - Optional: Add 1 tablespoon vinegar or wine

4. **Age:**
   - Store in glass or ceramic container
   - Age 1-2 weeks before use
   - Stir daily
   - Strain before use

5. **Adjustment:**
   - Too thin: Add more gum arabic
   - Too pale: Add more iron sulfate
   - Too thick: Add water
   - Smells bad: This is normal (iron sulfate odor)

**Alternative Iron Sources:**
- Rusty nails in vinegar (let sit 1-2 weeks)
- Iron filings in vinegar
- Steel wool in vinegar
- Produces iron acetate (works similarly)

**Testing:**
1. Write on scrap paper
2. Ink appears gray-blue when wet
3. Darkens to black as it oxidizes
4. Full darkness in 1-3 days
5. Should penetrate paper, visible from back

**Warning:** Too much iron sulfate makes ink corrosive. Use minimum amount needed for darkness. Add gum arabic for protection.

### Colored Inks

**Red Ink:**
- Madder root extract + gum arabic
- Red ochre (iron oxide) ground fine + binder
- Brazilwood extract
- Cochineal insects (crushed) + alum mordant

**Blue Ink:**
- Indigo + gum arabic
- Prussian blue (iron ferrocyanide - complex chemistry)
- Woad extract

**Yellow Ink:**
- Turmeric + gum arabic
- Saffron extract
- Safflower

**Green Ink:**
- Verdigris (copper acetate from copper in vinegar)
- Mix blue and yellow inks
- Copper sulfate solution

**General Color Ink Formula:**
1. Grind pigment to finest powder
2. Mix with gum arabic solution
3. Add water to desired consistency
4. Strain well
5. Test permanence before important use

### Ink Storage

- Glass bottles (best)
- Ceramic containers
- Avoid metal (reacts with iron gall ink)
- Cork or wax seal to prevent evaporation
- Label clearly
- Store in cool, dark place
- Ink can last years if sealed
- Add drop of clove oil or thyme oil to prevent mold

## Writing Implements

### Quill Pens (Traditional, Excellent)

**Feather Selection:**
- Goose feathers (most common)
- Swan (luxury, very large)
- Turkey (common, good)
- Crow or raven (fine lines)
- Use primary flight feathers (outer 5)
- Prefer wing feathers over tail
- Left wing for right-handed writers (natural curve)

**Preparation:**

1. **Cleaning:**
   - Strip barbs from lower 2/3 of feather
   - Leave tuft at top for appearance (optional)
   - Wipe shaft clean

2. **Hardening (Curing):**
   - Heat sand in pan until quite hot
   - Plunge feather shaft into hot sand
   - Leave 10-20 seconds
   - Remove and wipe
   - Shaft should be clear, hard, and slightly translucent
   - This process is called "dutching"

3. **Cutting the Nib:**
   - Use very sharp knife
   - Make first cut to remove tip at 45-degree angle
   - Scoop out inner membrane
   - Make slit up center of nib (1/4 inch)
   - Shape nib from underside with two cuts forming point
   - Final cut straight across for writing width
   - Sharpen point carefully

**Nib Shapes:**
- Fine point for small writing
- Broad nib for large letters
- Angled for calligraphy
- Recut as needed (each quill good for many cuts)

**Writing:**
- Dip in ink
- Wipe excess on bottle edge
- Write 10-20 words before re-dipping
- Gentle pressure (quill is flexible)
- Re-cut when nib gets rough

### Brush Pens (Asian Style)

**Construction:**
1. Hair/bristles: Rabbit, goat, wolf, weasel, or horsehair
2. Bundle bristles, tie firmly
3. Insert in hollow bamboo or reed handle
4. Seal with glue or wrap
5. Point should come to fine tip when wet

**Sizes:**
- Fine: 1/8 inch diameter
- Medium: 1/4 inch
- Large: 1/2 inch or more

**Use:**
- Wet brush, load with ink
- Hold vertically
- Pressure controls line width
- Excellent for Asian characters
- Good for large writing

### Pencils (Graphite in Wood)

**Graphite:**
- Natural mineral, soft carbon
- Mines: Cumberland (England) historically
- Can be found in metamorphic rocks
- Alternative: Charcoal (less permanent)

**Production:**

Method 1: Pure Graphite Stick
1. Find or mine graphite
2. Cut into thin sticks
3. Wrap in paper or insert in grooved wood
4. Simple but wastes graphite

Method 2: Graphite/Clay Mix (Modern Method)
1. Grind graphite to powder
2. Mix with clay (ratio determines hardness)
3. More clay = harder pencil
4. Form into thin rods
5. Dry completely
6. Fire in kiln (hardens)
7. Insert in wood casing

**Casing:**
1. Cut wood slat (cedar is traditional)
2. Groove down center with plane or saw
3. Lay graphite in groove
4. Glue second slat on top
5. Let dry
6. Shape into hexagonal or round cross-section
7. Sharpen to point with knife

**Advantages:**
- Doesn't require dipping
- Can be erased (bread crumbs or rubber)
- Good for sketches and temporary writing
- Doesn't fade like some inks

**Disadvantages:**
- Less permanent than ink
- Can smudge
- Graphite may be hard to find

## Printing Press Construction (Gutenberg-Style)

**The printing press revolutionized knowledge. This is your highest priority mechanical project.**

### Screw Press Mechanism

**Basic Principle:**
- Large wooden screw converts rotational motion to linear force
- Platen descends to press paper against inked type
- Even pressure across entire forme
- Similar to wine or olive press

**Materials Needed:**
- Hardwood (oak, maple, beech)
- Large wooden screw (2-3 inch diameter)
- Matching threaded block
- Heavy timbers for frame
- Flat metal or wood platen
- Bed/coffin for type forme
- Rails for moving bed

**Frame Construction:**

1. **Uprights:**
   - Two vertical posts, 6-8 feet tall
   - 6"x6" or larger timber
   - Mortised firmly into base
   - Top beam connecting uprights (hounce)

2. **Base:**
   - Heavy timber platform
   - Must not flex under pressure
   - 4'x3' or larger
   - Mounted on legs or bench

3. **Bed (Coffin):**
   - Flat surface that holds type forme
   - Slides in and out on rails
   - Stone surface ideal (flat, smooth)
   - 18"x24" working size minimum
   - Rails allow precise positioning

**Screw Mechanism:**

1. **Screw:**
   - 2-3 inch diameter, 12-18 inch length
   - Wooden screw (traditional) or metal (if available)
   - Thread pitch: 1/2 inch or coarser
   - Attached to platen at bottom

2. **Making Wooden Screw:**
   - Turn cylinder on lathe
   - Cut spiral groove (thread)
   - Smooth and harden with oil
   - OR carve by hand (very difficult)
   - Metal screw is much better if available

3. **Threaded Block (Nut):**
   - Mounted in hounce (top beam)
   - Wooden block with matching thread
   - OR metal nut
   - Must turn smoothly

4. **Lever (Bar):**
   - Long wooden arm attached to screw top
   - 3-4 feet length
   - Provides leverage for turning
   - Pull lever to lower platen

**Platen:**
- Flat pressing surface
- Attached to bottom of screw
- 12"x18" or larger
- Metal plate or very hard, flat wood
- Must be perfectly parallel to bed

**Operation:**
1. Bed rolls out on rails
2. Type forme is inked
3. Paper is positioned
4. Bed rolls under platen
5. Lever is pulled, lowering platen
6. Pressure applied for 1-2 seconds
7. Lever released, platen rises
8. Bed rolls out
9. Printed sheet removed

**Critical Points:**
- Frame must be absolutely rigid
- Platen must be parallel to bed
- Pressure must be even
- Smooth operation essential for speed

### Type Casting (Making Metal Type)

**Type Metal Alloy:**
- Lead: 60-80%
- Tin: 10-20%
- Antimony: 10-20%

**Why this alloy:**
- Low melting point (250-300C)
- Expands slightly when cooling (fills mold)
- Hard enough to withstand pressing
- Antimony prevents oxidation

**Type Mold (Critical Tool):**

A precision tool with two hinged parts that close to form letter-shaped cavity. This is the most complex and critical piece of equipment in the type foundry. Get this right and you can cast thousands of consistent type pieces. Get it wrong and your type will be unusable.

**Mold Construction (Hand Mold):**

Components:
1. **Body:** Two brass or steel blocks, hinged on one side
   - Must be perfectly flat where they meet (no gaps)
   - Hinge must be tight (no play)
   - Typical size: 4-6 inches long

2. **Matrix holder:** Slot at bottom of mold
   - Matrix slides in, held firmly
   - Forms face of letter (printing surface)
   - Must be removable to change letters

3. **Cavity:** Space inside closed mold
   - Rectangular column shape
   - Height: 0.918 inches (type-high) exactly
   - Width: Adjustable (see below - critical feature!)
   - Depth: Fixed for each mold (determines point size)

4. **Sprue opening:** Hole at top where metal pours in
   - Usually funnel-shaped
   - Connects to cavity

5. **Spring mechanism:** Keeps mold closed under pressure
   - Strong spring holds mold faces together
   - Released to open and extract type

**The Adjustable Width Mechanism (Why It's Essential):**

Different letters have different widths:
- "i" is narrow
- "W" or "M" are wide
- Each letter needs appropriate width for good appearance

**Without adjustable width:** You'd need a different mold for each letter width (impossible).

**With adjustable width:** One mold casts all letters by adjusting internal width.

**How Adjustment Works:**

**Simplest Method (Wedge System):**
1. **Sliding block inside mold:**
   - One side of cavity is movable
   - Slides left/right to change width
   - Locked in place with set screw or wedge

2. **Setting the width:**
   - Insert matrix
   - Adjust sliding block so cavity is just wide enough for letter
   - Letter should have small shoulder on each side (not cast edge-to-edge)
   - Lock adjustment

3. **Width consistency:**
   - Each letter cast from same matrix should be identical width
   - Important for even spacing in typeset lines

**Traditional Hand Mold (More Complex):**
1. **Two hinged halves**
2. **Register pins:** Ensure halves align perfectly
3. **Spring-loaded closure:** Keeps faces tight during pour
4. **Adjustable cheeks:** Internal plates that slide to change width
   - Usually one fixed, one movable
   - Adjusted via external screw mechanism
   - Can be preset for different letter widths
5. **Matrix clamp:** Mechanism to hold matrix firmly at bottom
6. **Ejector:** Sometimes integrated to help remove finished type

**Critical Tolerances:**

**Height (0.918"):**
- ALL type must be exactly this height
- Even 0.001" variation causes printing problems
- Height determined by mold cavity depth (fixed)
- Check frequently with calibrated gauge

**Width:**
- Each letter should be consistent (all "e"s same width)
- Shoulder spacing matters (too little = letters touch, too much = gaps)
- Traditional: 1/32" shoulder on each side

**Squareness:**
- Sides must be perfectly square to base
- Leaning type won't stand in forme
- Test: Cast type should stand straight

**Surface smoothness:**
- Mold interior must be smooth (rough = rough type = poor printing)
- Polish with fine abrasives
- Oil lightly to prevent sticking

**Making the Mold (Simplified Construction):**

**For Post-Collapse Foundry:**

1. **Materials:**
   - Brass blocks (best - doesn't stick to lead)
   - OR steel blocks (harder to work, but functional)
   - Hinge pin (brass or steel rod)
   - Spring (salvage or forge)

2. **Machining:**
   - Mill two blocks flat and parallel
   - Drill cavity (rectangular column, 0.918" deep exactly)
   - Machine slot for matrix at bottom
   - Create sliding block for width adjustment
   - Drill/tap for adjustment screw
   - Cut hinge joint
   - Polish interior surfaces

3. **Assembly:**
   - Fit hinge pin
   - Install spring
   - Test closure (should close tight, no gaps)
   - Install adjustment mechanism
   - Test with scrap metal before casting type

**Why This Is Hard:**

Precision required approaches limits of hand tooling:
- 0.918" height tolerance: ±0.002" maximum
- Faces must be flat to ±0.001"
- If salvaged machine tools available, use them
- If hand-filing only, takes weeks of careful work
- **Consider making ONE good mold your foundry's priority project**

**Simplified Alternative (Lower Quality):**

**Fixed-Width Mold:**
- No adjustment mechanism
- Make multiple molds for narrow, medium, wide letters
- Less precise, but easier to construct
- Acceptable for rough printing work
- NOT suitable for fine book work

**Making a Matrix:**

Method 1: Punch (Best)
1. Carve letter in reverse on steel punch
2. Harden punch (heat and quench)
3. Strike punch into soft copper blank
4. Creates letter impression
5. File and finish matrix

Method 2: Engraving
1. Engrave letter in reverse into copper
2. More difficult than punching
3. Allows more ornate designs

**Casting Process:**

1. Insert matrix into bottom of mold
2. Close mold firmly
3. Heat type metal in crucible until molten
4. Pour molten metal into mold opening
5. Metal fills cavity, forming type
6. Cool briefly (5-10 seconds)
7. Open mold, remove type
8. Close mold, repeat

**Safety:**
- Molten lead is dangerous
- Work in ventilated area
- Avoid breathing fumes
- Keep water away from molten metal (explodes)
- Wear leather gloves and apron

**Type Characteristics:**

- Height: All type same height (0.918 inches standard)
- Face: Letter surface, in reverse
- Body: Metal block
- Shoulder: Area around letter
- Nick: Groove to help orient type by touch
- Point size: Height of letter (measured in points)

**Production Rate:**
- Skilled caster: 3,000-4,000 pieces per day
- Need multiple copies of common letters
- E, T, A, O needed in quantity

### Composing Stick and Forme

**Composing Stick:**
- Small metal or wood tray
- Adjustable width
- Holds 2-3 lines of type while setting
- Compositor holds in left hand

**Setting Type:**
1. Pick individual letters from case
2. Place in stick from left to right
3. Letters upside down and backwards
4. Add spaces between words (blank type)
5. Fill line to exact width
6. Transfer line to galley (tray)

**Galley:**
- Flat tray with raised edges
- Holds set type before forming

**Forme (Form):**
- Type locked in chase (frame) for printing
- Chase: Metal or wood frame
- Quoins: Expanding wedges that lock type tight
- Furniture: Blank blocks filling space around type

**Building a Forme:**
1. Place type from galley into chase
2. Surround with furniture
3. Insert quoins at edges
4. Tighten quoins (with quoin key)
5. Type must be absolutely tight
6. Test: Press on type, nothing should move
7. Place forme on press bed

### Inking

**Ink Balls (Traditional):**
- Leather pads stuffed with wool or horsehair
- Handle attached
- Two balls used together
- Pounded together to distribute ink evenly
- Then pounded on type

**Ink Roller (Better):**
- Cylinder covered with leather or composition
- Handle or frame for rolling
- Roll in ink, then roll over type
- More even coverage
- Faster

**Inking Process:**
1. Place small amount of ink on ink table
2. Work ink with balls or roller
3. Ink should be tacky, not too thin or thick
4. Apply to type forme with rolling/pounding motion
5. Coverage should be even
6. Not too much (smudges) or too little (faint)

**Ink for Printing:**
- Thicker than writing ink
- Carbon black + linseed oil (boiled)
- Ratio: 1 part carbon to 2-3 parts thick oil
- Grind together thoroughly
- Should be thick paste consistency

**Ink Viscosity Adjustment (Critical for Quality):**

Ink consistency determines print quality. Too thick or thin causes problems.

**Ideal Consistency:**
- **Texture**: Thick honey or soft butter
- **Tack**: Sticky/tacky (pulls slightly when touched)
- **Spreading**: Doesn't run or drip, but spreads under roller
- **Sound**: Slight "tacky" sound when roller lifts from ink table
- **String test**: When dabber lifts, ink should form short strings that break cleanly

**Too Thick (Common Problem):**

**Signs:**
- Hard to spread on ink table
- Doesn't transfer evenly to type
- Roller skips or chatters
- Prints with heavy, uneven coverage
- Difficult to clean from type

**Causes:**
- Too much pigment
- Not enough oil/vehicle
- Cold temperature (ink stiffens)
- Evaporation (old ink, exposed to air)

**Fixes:**
1. **Add oil** (most common fix):
   - Add boiled linseed oil drop by drop
   - Mix thoroughly
   - Test on scrap
   - Goal: Spreadable but still tacky
2. **Warm ink**:
   - Place ink pot in warm water bath
   - Don't overheat (breaks down ink)
   - 70-80°F (21-27°C) ideal working temperature
3. **Add thinning varnish**:
   - Linseed oil boiled down to thicker consistency
   - Maintains tack better than raw oil

**Too Thin (Less Common, but Serious):**

**Signs:**
- Runs or drips
- Soaks into paper (haloing)
- Smudges easily
- Offset (transfers to back of next sheet)
- Fills in fine detail (type counters fill with ink)

**Causes:**
- Too much oil
- Wrong oil type (raw linseed, not boiled)
- Too warm
- Over-thinned

**Fixes:**
1. **Evaporate excess oil**:
   - Spread ink thin on glass plate
   - Let sit exposed to air for hours to days
   - Scrape up when thickened
2. **Add pigment**:
   - Mix in more carbon black powder
   - Grind thoroughly to incorporate
   - Time-consuming but effective
3. **Add body**:
   - Mix in thick varnish (boiled linseed oil reduced)
   - Small amounts at a time
   - Restores tack and body

**Tack Adjustment:**

"Tack" is stickiness - critical for ink transfer from roller to type to paper.

**Increase Tack:**
- Add thick varnish (boiled linseed oil, reduced)
- Add rosin (small amount)
- Reduce solvent/thinner

**Decrease Tack** (if too sticky):
- Add small amount of tallow or beeswax
- Add oil (reduces cohesion)
- Caution: Don't reduce too much or ink won't transfer

**Seasonal Adjustments:**

**Summer/Hot Weather:**
- Ink softens
- May need more pigment or varnish
- Work in cooler part of day

**Winter/Cold Weather:**
- Ink stiffens
- May need warming or thinning
- Keep ink pot near (not on) heat source

**Testing Ink Consistency:**

**Ink Table Test:**
1. Roll ink on ink table
2. Should spread thin and even
3. Should have slight sheen
4. Should not pool or run

**Type Test:**
1. Ink small section of type
2. Make test impression
3. **Good ink**: Even coverage, sharp edges, no filling
4. **Too thick**: Uneven, light coverage
5. **Too thin**: Smudgy, fills counters, feathering

**Roller Sound Test:**
- Roll inked roller slowly
- Should hear soft, tacky "hiss" or "crackle"
- Silent = too thin
- Loud sticking/popping = too thick or tacky

**Modifying Base Formulas:**

**For Fine Detail Work** (small type, woodcuts):
- Slightly thinner ink
- Less tack (easier to wipe from non-printing areas)
- May sacrifice some opacity

**For Solid Coverage** (large areas, borders):
- Slightly thicker ink
- More tack (better transfer)
- Build up in multiple impressions if needed

**For Rough Paper:**
- Thinner, more penetrating ink
- Fills paper texture better

**For Smooth Paper:**
- Standard or slightly thicker ink
- Takes advantage of smooth surface

**Storage and Reuse:**

- Store ink in sealed container (prevents evaporation)
- Skin forms on surface (peel off and discard)
- Can rejuvenate old ink by adding oil and mixing
- Add drop of lavender oil to prevent mold (traditional)

**Safety:**
- Linseed oil-soaked rags can spontaneously combust
- Spread rags flat to dry, or store in water-filled sealed container
- Never pile oil-soaked rags (fire hazard)

### Printing Process

**Setup:**
1. Lock forme in press bed
2. Check that type is level
3. Prepare ink
4. Dampen paper slightly (helps ink adhesion)
5. Prepare tympan (frame that holds paper)

**Tympan:**
- Hinged frame with parchment or cloth stretched over it
- Folds down over type
- Holds paper in position
- Frisket: Second frame with cutouts, prevents smudging

**Printing Sequence:**

1. **Ink the forme:** Roll or beat ink evenly over type
2. **Position paper:** Lay sheet on tympan
3. **Fold tympan down:** Paper now covers type
4. **Roll bed under platen:** Slide bed on rails
5. **Pull bar:** Lower platen with pressure
   - **Typical pressure**: 100-150 PSI (pounds per square inch) for letterpress
   - Too little: Faint, incomplete impression
   - Too much: Broken type, embossed/damaged paper, press frame stress
   - **Estimating force**: For 8"x10" forme (80 sq in), total force = 8,000-12,000 lbs
   - Screw press mechanical advantage: ~20:1 to 40:1 (one person can generate sufficient force)
6. **Hold 1-2 seconds:** Even pressure across entire impression
7. **Release bar:** Platen rises
8. **Roll bed out:** Back to starting position
9. **Lift tympan:** Reveal printed sheet
10. **Remove sheet:** Hang or lay to dry
11. **Repeat:** Next sheet

**Production Rate:**
- Experienced printer: 200-250 sheets per hour
- Two workers (one inking, one pressing): 300+ per hour
- Both sides printed separately (if needed)

**Common Problems:**
- Uneven impression: Press platen not level, adjust
- Faint printing: More ink or more pressure
- Smudging: Too much ink
- Offset: Ink too wet, sheets touching
- Broken type: Excessive pressure, replace

### Multi-Color Printing and Registration

Printing multiple colors on the same sheet requires precise alignment (registration) so each color prints exactly where intended.

**What Is Registration:**
- Aligning paper in exactly the same position for each impression
- Critical for multi-color work (colors must not overlap incorrectly)
- Also important for printing both sides (verso/recto alignment)

**When You Need Registration:**
- Multi-color illustrations (woodcuts in different colors)
- Decorative borders + text in different colors
- Two-sided printing with precise alignment
- Maps with colored regions

**Registration Methods:**

**Method 1: Pin Registration (Most Accurate):**

**Construction:**
1. **Pins on tympan:**
   - Two metal pins or nails, fixed to tympan frame or frisket
   - Positioned at non-printing edge of paper (usually top or side)
   - Spacing: ~6-8 inches apart
   - Height: Just tall enough to pierce paper edge (1/4")

2. **Making register holes:**
   - Use special punch tool (sharp hollow tube)
   - OR carefully push paper onto pins to create holes
   - Mark first sheet carefully as template
   - Use template to punch all sheets identically before printing

**Process:**
1. Punch register holes in all sheets (same location)
2. Print first color:
   - Push sheet onto pins (paper hangs from pins)
   - Lower tympan, print
   - Remove sheet, hang to dry
3. Print second color:
   - Replace forme with second color type/block
   - Push dried sheet onto same pins
   - Paper registers in exact same position
   - Print second color
4. Repeat for additional colors

**Advantages:**
- Very accurate (±1/64" if done carefully)
- Works for any number of colors
- Repeatable

**Disadvantages:**
- Holes in paper edge (usually trimmed off later)
- Extra step (punching holes)
- Need pin fixture on press

**Method 2: Corner Guides (Simpler):**

**Construction:**
1. **Lay guides on tympan:**
   - Two strips of card or wood forming "L" shape corner
   - Positioned where paper will lay
   - Glued or pinned to tympan
   - Must be positioned consistently for all runs

**Process:**
1. Print first color:
   - Butt paper edge against corner guides
   - Always same two edges (e.g., top and left)
   - Print
2. Print second color:
   - Change forme
   - Butt paper against same corner guides
   - Paper should align identically
   - Print

**Advantages:**
- No holes in paper
- Simple to set up
- Works well for coarse registration

**Disadvantages:**
- Less accurate than pins (paper thickness variations, guide movement)
- Paper must be very square and consistent size
- Humidity changes paper size = misregistration

**Accuracy: ±1/16" typical** (adequate for decorative work, not fine detail)

**Method 3: Alignment Marks (For Woodcuts):**

**Construction:**
1. **Cut registration marks into first woodblock:**
   - Small crosses or dots at corners of image area
   - Print with first color

2. **See-through layout:**
   - Cut second woodblock with same registration marks
   - When setting up second block in forme:
     - Make proof impression
     - Overlay proof on first color print
     - Adjust block position until marks align
     - Lock block in that position

**Process:**
1. Print first color with registration marks
2. Align second block using marks
3. Print second color
4. Registration marks usually in margin (trimmed later)

**Method 4: Transparent Overlay (Setup Aid):**

**For Initial Setup:**
1. Print black key image (usually outlines)
2. Place transparent sheet (oiled paper, thin vellum) over key
3. Trace outlines on overlay
4. Use overlay to position subsequent color blocks:
   - Lay overlay on second color block
   - Adjust block until image aligns with traced outlines
   - Lock block in that position

**Tips for Accurate Registration:**

**Paper Considerations:**
- Use paper from same batch (consistent size)
- Store flat, at consistent humidity (paper swells/shrinks)
- Cut all sheets precisely square
- Let paper acclimate to print shop (same humidity as when printing)

**Press Setup:**
- Tympan must fold down identically every time
- Bed must stop in exact same position
- Check registration every 20-50 sheets (guides may shift)

**Color Sequence:**
- Print lightest color first (yellows, light greens)
- Progress to darker colors
- Print black last (hides minor misregistration)
- Let each color dry completely before next (at least 24 hours)

**Testing:**
- Print test sheets first
- Check registration before running full job
- Adjust as needed
- Keep first perfect sheet as reference

**Acceptable Tolerances:**

- **Fine work (small text, detailed maps)**: ±1/32" (pin registration required)
- **Decorative borders**: ±1/16" (corner guides acceptable)
- **Solid color areas**: ±1/8" (rough alignment okay)

**Historical Note:**
Early color printing (15th-16th century) used these exact techniques. Multi-color woodblock prints from Japan (ukiyo-e) and European illustrated books achieved stunning accuracy with just pins or corner guides. Chromolithography (19th century) used multiple stone blocks with registration marks. You're using proven methods.

**Beginner Project:**
Start with two-color border (red + black) using corner guides. Then progress to pin registration for more precise work. Don't attempt 3+ colors until you master two-color registration.

## Woodcut Illustrations and Image Blocks

Movable type handles text well, but illustrations require a different approach. Woodcuts allow you to print images alongside text.

### What Is a Woodcut

**Principle:**
- Relief printing (same as type)
- Raised areas print, cut-away areas don't
- Ink applied to surface, pressed onto paper
- Can be printed on same press as type

**Advantages:**
- Simple tools required (knives, gouges)
- Durable (hundreds to thousands of impressions)
- Can be combined with type in same forme
- No complex chemistry or metals needed

**Limitations:**
- Time-consuming (hours to weeks per block)
- Limited fine detail compared to engraving
- Difficult to correct mistakes (cut away = permanent)

### Wood Selection

**Best Woods for Woodcuts:**

**Plankwood (Side-Grain) Blocks** (Easier, Traditional):
- Grain runs parallel to printing surface
- Easier to carve (knife follows grain)
- Best woods:
  - **Pear**: Smooth, fine grain (excellent)
  - **Cherry**: Fine grain, works well
  - **Maple**: Hard but good for detail
  - **Apple**: Fine, dense (if available)
  - **Basswood/Linden**: Soft, easy to carve (but less durable)
- Avoid: Pine (too soft, splinters), oak (too coarse grain)

**End-Grain Blocks** (Advanced, Best Quality):
- Grain runs perpendicular to printing surface
- Allows finer detail (can cut in any direction)
- Requires harder woods:
  - **Boxwood**: Historical gold standard (very hard, fine grain)
  - **Hard maple**: Acceptable substitute
  - **Fruit woods end-grain**: Pear, cherry (if boxwood unavailable)
- More difficult to carve (requires specialized burins)
- Superior for fine detail and cross-hatching

**Block Preparation:**
1. **Cut block** to size
   - Must be **type-high**: 0.918 inches (23.32mm)
   - This is critical - must match type height exactly
   - Width/length: As needed for image
2. **Season wood**: Thoroughly dry (prevents warping)
3. **Sand smooth**: Printing surface perfectly flat
4. **Seal edges**: Prevents warping from moisture

### Carving Tools

**Essential Tools:**

1. **Knives:**
   - Small, sharp blade (like craft knife)
   - For outline cuts and fine detail
   - Keep very sharp

2. **Gouges:**
   - U-shaped cutting edge
   - Various widths (2mm to 10mm)
   - For removing background material
   - Sizes: Small (detail), medium (general), large (open areas)

3. **V-tools:**
   - V-shaped cutting edge
   - For fine lines and details

4. **Sharpening stone:**
   - Critical - dull tools cause tear-out and mistakes
   - Fine grit for honing edge

**Tool Making:**
- Can forge gouges from nails or rods
- Grind to shape, harden, temper
- See Chapter 2 (Metalworking) for tool hardening

### Design Transfer

**Preparing the Design:**

1. **Draw design** on paper
   - Remember: Mirror image of what you draw will print
   - **Text must be backwards** (mirror writing)
   - Black areas = raised (will print)
   - White areas = cut away (won't print)

2. **Transfer to block:**
   - **Method 1 (Simple)**: Draw directly on block with pencil
   - **Method 2 (Accurate)**:
     - Draw on thin paper with dark ink
     - Place face-down on block
     - Dampen paper slightly
     - Burnish/rub (transfers ink to wood)
   - **Method 3 (Carbon paper)**: Trace through carbon paper

3. **Refine drawing** on block
   - Clear outlines
   - Mark areas to cut away (X or hatching)

### Carving Process

**Step by Step:**

1. **Outline cut:**
   - Use knife to cut vertically around all lines you want to preserve
   - Depth: 1/8 inch (3mm) or deeper
   - Cut cleanly - this defines your image

2. **Relief cut:**
   - Angle knife outward from outline
   - Cut away wood at 45° angle
   - Creates clearance so background doesn't print

3. **Remove background:**
   - Use gouges to remove large areas
   - Work away from detail (if you slip, won't damage image)
   - Depth: At least 1/8 inch below surface
   - Don't have to go deep - just below inking level

4. **Fine detail:**
   - Small knives and narrow gouges
   - Take your time
   - Remember: Can't add wood back

5. **Clean up:**
   - Remove splinters
   - Smooth cut areas
   - Check edges are crisp

**Safety:**
- Always cut AWAY from your body
- Secure block (vise, bench hook, or clamp)
- Sharp tools safer than dull (less force needed)
- Protect non-carving hand

### Proofing the Block

**Test Print:**

1. **Ink block lightly:**
   - Use leather dauber or roller
   - Thin ink coat (too much fills in detail)

2. **Place paper on block:**
   - Thin paper best for proofing
   - Position carefully

3. **Burnish:**
   - Rub back of paper with smooth tool
   - OR use press with light pressure

4. **Examine proof:**
   - Look for: Unintended printing (background showing)
   - Missing detail (needs to be raised more)
   - Broken lines (too delicate, may need to widen)

5. **Correct and reproof:**
   - Carve away any printing areas
   - Cannot fix removed areas (cut carefully!)

### Combining Woodcuts with Type

**In the Forme:**

1. **Type-high requirement:**
   - Woodblock must be EXACTLY 0.918" high
   - If too low: Won't print (no contact with paper)
   - If too high: Excessive pressure, may crack block or damage press
   - **Solution for low blocks**: Glue to thicker base or shim with paper

2. **Locking up:**
   - Place woodblock in forme with type
   - Use furniture and quoins to lock securely
   - Block must not move during printing

3. **Inking:**
   - Type and block can be inked together
   - OR ink block separately before inserting in forme (if different ink needed)

**Page Layout:**
- Woodcut can be:
  - Full page illustration
  - Column-width (text wraps around)
  - Small vignette between paragraphs
  - Initial letter decoration (large ornate first letter)

### Durability and Maintenance

**Block Lifespan:**
- Hardwood, well-made: 1,000-10,000 impressions
- Softwood: 100-500 impressions
- Fine detail wears first (thin lines)

**Maintenance:**
- Clean after use (remove all ink)
- Do not soak in water (warps wood)
- Store flat, dry location
- Oil lightly occasionally (linseed oil)

**Repair:**
- Worn detail can sometimes be re-cut
- Cracks can be filled with wood putty (if not in image area)

### Historical Context

Woodcut printing existed in China by 9th century and Europe by 14th century. Gutenberg's innovation was movable metal type, but woodcuts remained standard for illustrations until 19th century photo-engraving. Books like Albrecht Dürer's apocalypse prints and early scientific texts relied heavily on woodcuts. You're using 600-year-old proven technology.

### Quick Start Guide

**Beginner Project:**
1. Start simple: Border, ornament, or simple symbol
2. Use soft wood (basswood) to learn technique
3. Make block type-high
4. Draw design (remember: mirror image)
5. Cut outline, then remove background
6. Proof, correct, proof again
7. When satisfied, print and use

**Practice on:**
- Printer's mark (your symbol for imprints)
- Page borders
- Simple diagrams for technical manuals
- Decorative initials

**As you improve:**
- More complex illustrations
- Harder woods (better detail)
- Combined text and image pages

## Engraving and Etching (Intaglio Printing)

Intaglio is the opposite of relief printing. Instead of raised areas printing, **recessed areas** hold ink and transfer to paper under high pressure. This allows finer detail than woodcuts.

### What Is Intaglio Printing

**Principle:**
- Image carved or etched INTO metal plate (usually copper)
- Entire plate inked
- Surface wiped clean (ink remains in grooves)
- Dampened paper pressed into grooves under very high pressure
- Ink transfers from grooves to paper

**Advantages:**
- Extremely fine detail possible (finer than woodcuts)
- Subtle gradations (cross-hatching depth varies tone)
- Elegant line work
- Traditional method for maps, technical diagrams, fine art

**Disadvantages:**
- Requires metal plate (copper preferred)
- Requires different press (much higher pressure than relief printing)
- Cannot be combined with movable type in same impression
- Slower printing (wiping plate between impressions)
- More complex than woodcuts

**Two Main Methods:**

### 1. Engraving (Mechanical)

**What It Is:**
Cutting directly into metal plate with steel tool (burin/graver).

**Tools:**

**Burin (Graver):**
- Steel tool with angled cutting edge
- Pushed through metal, removing curl of material
- Various shapes:
  - Square/lozenge: General lines
  - Round: Curved lines
  - Multiple-line: Parallel lines in one stroke
- Must be extremely sharp and hard (harder than plate)

**Making a Burin:**
1. Use high-carbon steel rod (old file works)
2. Grind to shape: 45° angle cutting face
3. Harden (heat to red, quench in oil)
4. Temper lightly (straw color)
5. Polish cutting edge to mirror finish
6. Mount in wooden handle

**Plate Material:**
- **Copper**: Best (soft enough to engrave, hard enough to print many copies)
- **Brass**: Acceptable (slightly harder)
- **Zinc**: Softer (easier to engrave, wears faster)
- **Steel**: Very hard (requires more force, lasts longest)

**Plate Preparation:**
1. Cut plate to size (typically 6"x8" to 12"x16")
2. File edges smooth (no burrs)
3. Polish surface to mirror finish
   - Use progressively finer abrasives
   - Final polish: Chalk or jeweler's rouge
4. Degrease thoroughly (wipe with alcohol or ash lye)

**Engraving Process:**

1. **Transfer design** to plate:
   - Draw on paper
   - Transfer with carbon paper or burnishing method
   - OR draw directly on plate with scribe

2. **Engraving:**
   - Hold burin at low angle (15-20°)
   - Push forward with controlled force
   - Tool cuts thin groove (line)
   - Removed metal curls up ahead of burin
   - Depth of cut controls line thickness and ink capacity
   - For thicker lines: Make multiple passes or use wider burin

3. **Remove burrs:**
   - Scraper removes metal ridges at groove edges
   - Critical: Burrs would hold unwanted ink

4. **Corrections:**
   - Burnisher: Rub out mistakes (smooths metal back)
   - Scraper: Remove surface scratches
   - Re-polish area

**Line Techniques:**
- **Hatching**: Parallel lines create tone
- **Cross-hatching**: Overlapping lines create darker tone
- **Stippling**: Dots create gradation
- **Varying depth**: Deeper grooves hold more ink = darker printing

### 2. Etching (Chemical)

**What It Is:**
Using acid to "eat" into metal plate where coating is removed.

**Advantages Over Engraving:**
- Easier (drawing with needle, not forcing through metal)
- Faster for complex images
- Acid does the work

**Disadvantages:**
- Requires acids (dangerous)
- More steps
- Less control over line quality

**Ground (Resist Coating):**

**Hard Ground Recipe:**
- 4 parts beeswax
- 4 parts asphaltum (bitumen)
- 1 part rosin
- Melt together, stir, let cool into cakes

**Application:**
1. Warm plate slightly (not hot)
2. Rub ground ball over surface
3. Spread evenly with leather roller
4. Smoke over candle flame (blackens ground, easier to see lines)
5. Let cool completely

**Etching Process:**

1. **Draw design:**
   - Use sharp steel needle
   - Scratch through ground to bare metal
   - Don't scratch deep - just expose metal
   - Ground removal = acid will etch there

2. **Protect back and edges:**
   - Paint back of plate with asphaltum varnish
   - Paint edges
   - Only front image area exposed

3. **Acid bath:**
   - **Nitric acid solution**: 1 part acid to 3-5 parts water
     - ALWAYS add acid to water (not water to acid)
     - See Chapter 4 for acid safety
   - OR **Ferric chloride**: Safer, slower
   - Immerse plate face-up
   - Bubbles form in scratched lines (acid working)
   - Time: 15 minutes to 1 hour (test to learn)
   - Deeper etch = darker printing

4. **Stop-out for gradation:**
   - Remove from acid
   - Rinse, dry
   - Paint asphaltum over areas that are dark enough
   - Re-immerse for deeper etching of remaining areas
   - Creates tonal variation (light and dark areas)

5. **Clean plate:**
   - Remove ground (turpentine or alcohol)
   - Remove protective varnish
   - Clean thoroughly

**Aquatint (Tone Areas):**
Advanced technique for creating even tones (not just lines).

1. Dust rosin powder on plate
2. Heat plate gently (rosin melts into tiny dots)
3. Etch (acid eats between rosin dots)
4. Creates porous surface that holds ink = tonal area
5. Stop-out painted areas to create gradations

### Intaglio Press Requirements

**Not a Standard Printing Press:**

- Requires **much higher pressure** (5-10 tons)
- **Roller press**: Two heavy steel rollers
- Plate and paper pass between rollers (like old clothes wringer)
- Pressure forces paper into grooves

**Simple Roller Press Construction:**

1. **Two heavy steel rollers**:
   - 6-8 inch diameter
   - Perfectly parallel
   - Bearings on both ends
   - Gap adjustable (for different plate thicknesses)

2. **Bed**:
   - Flat steel plate
   - Slides between rollers
   - Plate and paper placed on bed

3. **Pressure adjustment**:
   - Screws to raise/lower top roller
   - Enormous pressure needed

4. **Drive**:
   - Large wheel or crank
   - Geared down for mechanical advantage
   - Slow, steady pull

**Alternative (Primitive):**
Some pressure can be achieved with extreme weight on burnisher, but results will be inferior to proper press.

### Inking Intaglio Plates

**Process:**

1. **Warm plate slightly** (helps ink flow into grooves)

2. **Apply ink liberally:**
   - Thick, stiff ink (see Ink section)
   - Spread over entire plate surface
   - Work into grooves with dabber or card

3. **Wipe surface clean:**
   - Wipe with tarlatán (stiff gauze fabric)
   - Removes ink from surface
   - Leaves ink in grooves
   - Final wipe: Side of hand (gentle, removes last traces)
   - Surface should be clean, grooves full

4. **Polish highlights** (optional):
   - Whiting (chalk powder) on hand
   - Polish very lightly (brightest highlights)

### Printing

1. **Soak paper:**
   - Thick, quality rag paper
   - Soak 10-30 minutes
   - Blot between felts (damp, not wet)
   - Damp paper conforms to grooves better

2. **Place inked plate on press bed**

3. **Lay dampened paper over plate**
   - Position carefully (cannot reposition after pressing)

4. **Cover with felt blankets:**
   - 2-3 thick wool blankets
   - Cushions paper into grooves
   - Protects paper from rollers

5. **Run through press:**
   - Steady, even speed
   - Enormous pressure (adjust until good impression)

6. **Peel print from plate:**
   - Carefully (paper is damp and fragile)

7. **Dry print:**
   - Lay flat between blotters
   - Press flat while drying
   - May take several days

**Plate Lifespan:**
- Copper plate: 100-500 good impressions before lines wear
- Steel plate: Thousands of impressions
- Can be re-engraved or re-etched when worn

### When to Use Intaglio vs. Woodcut

**Use Intaglio for:**
- Maps (fine detail, precise lines)
- Technical diagrams (scientific instruments, anatomy)
- Portraits (subtle gradation)
- Fine art reproduction
- Currency/certificates (harder to forge than woodcuts)

**Use Woodcuts for:**
- Text illustrations (can print with type)
- Bold graphics
- Faster production
- When you lack metal or press

### Safety

**Acid Hazards:**
- Nitric acid fumes damage lungs
- Acid burns skin severely
- Work outdoors or with excellent ventilation
- Wear gloves, eye protection
- See Chapter 4 for acid safety

**Press Hazards:**
- Extreme pinch points (rollers crush anything between them)
- Keep hands clear
- Emergency release mechanism essential

### Historical Context

Intaglio printing dates to 15th century Europe. Early maps, currency, and fine art used engraving. Etching became popular in 17th century (Rembrandt's etchings are masterpieces). By 18th-19th century, almost all quality illustration used intaglio. Photography and photoengraving replaced hand-engraving in late 19th century, but the technique works perfectly well post-collapse.

### Getting Started

**Beginner Path:**
1. **Start with etching** (easier than engraving)
2. **Small plate** (4"x6")
3. **Simple design** (text, border, simple map)
4. **Learn acid safety** thoroughly first
5. **Build or acquire press** (critical - hand-burnishing won't work well)
6. **Progress to engraving** once you understand the process

**First Project:**
- Community map
- Printer's mark
- Certificate border
- Title page illustration

## Movable Type Organization

### Type Case

**Layout:**
- Wooden tray divided into compartments
- Upper case: Capital letters (hence "uppercase")
- Lower case: Small letters (hence "lowercase")
- Each letter has compartment sized by frequency of use

**Traditional Layout (compositor's case):**
- Most common letters in easy reach
- "e" gets largest compartment (most used in English)
- "z" gets small compartment (rarely used)
- Numbers, punctuation in separate sections

**Compartment Sizes by Frequency:**
Large: e, t, a, o, i, n, s, h, r
Medium: l, d, c, u, m, w, f, g, y, p, b
Small: v, k, j, x, q, z

**Multiple Fonts:**
- Different cases for different typefaces
- Different sizes need different cases
- Label each case clearly

### Setting Type (Composition)

**Skills Required:**
- Reading backwards (type is reversed)
- Speed (practice essential)
- Accuracy (errors multiply)
- Spacing judgment

**Process:**
1. Read manuscript
2. Pick letters from case one at a time
3. Place in composing stick
4. Add spaces between words
5. Justify line (make even length)
6. Transfer to galley when stick full

**Justification:**
- Adding spaces to make line exact width
- Thin spaces for fine adjustment
- Tight lines resist shifting
- Must be uniform across page

**Special Characters:**
- Ligatures: Combined letters (fi, fl)
- Dashes: Em-dash, en-dash
- Spaces: Em-quad, en-quad, thin space
- Leaders: Dots for tables

**Proofreading:**
1. Pull proof (test print)
2. Read carefully against manuscript
3. Mark errors
4. Unlock forme
5. Correct errors
6. Lock up again
7. Pull new proof
8. Repeat until perfect

**Distribution (After Printing):**
1. Unlock forme
2. Pick up type piece by piece
3. Return each to its compartment
4. Keep case organized
5. Clean type occasionally

## Bookbinding

Loose printed sheets must become durable books.

### Folding Signatures

**Signature:** Group of pages printed on single large sheet, then folded.

**Folio:** Sheet folded once = 4 pages
**Quarto:** Sheet folded twice = 8 pages
**Octavo:** Sheet folded three times = 16 pages
**Sextodecimo:** Sheet folded four times = 32 pages

**Folding Process:**
1. Print large sheet with multiple pages
2. Pages arranged so they're in order after folding
3. Fold carefully, crease sharply
4. Bone folder tool for crisp creases
5. Stack signatures in order

**Imposition:**
- Arrangement of pages on sheet for correct order after folding
- Complex layout
- Signature marks help keep order

### Sewing

**Tools:**
- Needles (large, blunt)
- Linen or hemp thread (waxed)
- Sewing frame (optional but helpful)
- Awl for punching holes

**Sewing Frame:**
- Upright frame with cords stretched across
- Signatures sewn to cords
- Cords become part of binding

**Method 1: Simple Pamphlet Stitch**
1. Fold signature
2. Punch 3-5 holes along spine fold
3. Sew in-and-out through holes

5. Single signature only

**Method 2: Kettle Stitch (Multiple Signatures)**
1. Stack signatures in order
2. Punch holes through all spines (aligned)
3. Sew through first signature
4. Link to next signature with kettle stitch
5. Continue through all signatures
6. Creates flexible book block

**Method 3: Sewing on Cords (Traditional)**
1. Punch holes where cords cross spine
2. Sew each signature around cords
3. Signatures linked to each other
4. Cords extend beyond book block
5. Cords attach to covers

### Cover Construction

**Materials:**
- Thick paper or thin wood boards
- Leather, cloth, or heavy paper
- Adhesive (wheat paste or hide glue)
- Endpapers (decorative first/last pages)

**Board Preparation:**
1. Cut two boards slightly larger than pages
2. Boards should be stiff
3. Binder's board (thick cardboard) traditional
4. Wood works for large books

**Attaching Covers:**

Method 1: Cords Laced In
1. Cords from sewing extend past spine
2. Drill holes in cover boards
3. Thread cords through holes
4. Fray and paste cords inside covers
5. Very strong attachment

Method 2: Glue and Cloth
1. Glue cloth strip to spine of book block
2. Glue covers to cloth
3. Simpler but less durable

**Covering:**
1. Cut leather or cloth larger than boards
2. Paste adhesive to boards
3. Lay covering material
4. Wrap around edges

- Clasps: Optional, hold book closed
- Edges: Can be gilded or colored

### Preservation

**Environmental:**
- Cool, dry storage (15-20C, 30-50% humidity)
- Avoid direct sunlight
- Good air circulation
- Pest control (silverfish, beetles, mice)

**Handling:**
- Clean hands
- Support spine when opening
- Don't force books open flat
- Use bookmarks, not folded corners

**Repair:**
- Re-sew loose signatures
- Replace damaged boards
- Clean with soft brush
- Never use tape on pages

**Protective Storage:**
- Boxes for valuable books
- Vertical storage (don't stack)
- Not too tight on shelf (damages spines)

## Alternative Reproduction Methods

When printing press is not available, other methods can multiply copies.

### Carbon Copying

**Principle:** Transfer carbon to back of sheet, then pressure from writing transfers carbon to sheet below.

**Making Carbon Paper:**

Materials:
- Thin paper
- Carbon black or very fine soot
- Wax or oil

Process:
1. Mix carbon with melted wax or oil
2. Apply to one side of thin paper
3. Spread evenly
4. Let dry/cool
5. Wipe excess

**Use:**
1. Place carbon paper between sheets (carbon side down)
2. Write on top sheet with pressure
3. Carbon transfers to bottom sheet
4. Can copy 2-3 sheets at once

**Limitations:**
- Copies are less sharp
- Limited number of copies
- Carbon can smudge

### Mimeograph/Stencil Duplicating

**Principle:** Cut stencil, force ink through holes onto paper.

**Stencil Making:**

Materials:
- Waxed paper or thin fabric coated with wax
- Stylus or typewriter (without ribbon)

Process:
1. Write or type on stencil
2. Pressure breaks wax coating
3. Creates permeable areas

**Printing:**
1. Mount stencil on frame or drum
2. Place paper beneath
3. Apply ink to top of stencil
4. Roller forces ink through stencil
5. Ink transfers to paper

**Advantages:**
- 50-100 copies per stencil
- Much faster than hand copying
- Simpler than printing press

**Disadvantages:**
- Lower quality than printing
- Stencils wear out
- Limited detail

### Hectograph/Gelatin Duplicating

**Principle:** Ink transfers to gelatin, then to paper.

**Gelatin Pad:**
1. Dissolve gelatin in water (very concentrated)
2. Add glycerin (keeps gelatin soft)
3. Pour into flat pan
4. Let set

**Process:**
1. Write with special ink (aniline dye based)
2. While wet, press onto gelatin pad
3. Ink transfers to gelatin
4. Press blank papers onto gelatin
5. Each picks up some ink

**Copies:**
- First few: Very clear
- 20-30: Readable
- 50+: Very faint

**Advantages:**
- No mechanical equipment
- Simple
- Fast for small runs

**Disadvantages:**
- Copies degrade quickly

- Special ink needed

### Photography (If Chemicals Available)

**Photographic reproduction of documents:**

If you can make photographic chemicals (see Photography chapter), you can:
1. Photograph document
2. Make negative
3. Print multiple copies

**Photostat/Contact Printing:**
1. Place document on light-sensitive paper
2. Expose to light
3. Develop
4. Creates negative copy
5. Repeat to make positive

**Advantages:**
- Exact reproduction
- Any document can be copied
- No typesetting needed

**Disadvantages:**
- Requires chemical industry
- Each copy needs processing
- Not as permanent as printing

## Paper Preservation

**Books decay. You must fight this.**

### Causes of Deterioration

**Acid:**
- Wood pulp paper contains lignin
- Oxidizes to acid over time
- Acid breaks down cellulose
- Paper becomes brittle and brown
- Rag paper (cotton/linen) is naturally acid-free

**Light:**
- UV radiation breaks down fibers
- Causes fading and brittleness
- Keep books away from windows

**Humidity:**
- Promotes mold growth
- Causes foxing (brown spots)
- Accelerates acid formation
- Warps and cockles pages

**Pests:**
- Silverfish eat paper
- Bookworms tunnel through
- Mice nest in books
- Cockroaches damage bindings

**Poor Storage:**
- Stacking puts pressure on spines
- Tight shelving damages books
- Sunlight fades covers
- Damp basements promote mold

### Preservation Strategies

**Use Quality Materials:**
- Rag paper over wood pulp
- Iron gall ink (permanent)
- Strong sewing and binding
- Leather or cloth covers

**Control Environment:**
- Temperature: 15-20C (cool)
- Humidity: 30-50% (moderate)
- Darkness: Minimal light exposure
- Cleanliness: Dust promotes deterioration

**Proper Storage:**
- Vertical shelving (like bookstore)
- Books not packed too tight
- Support for large books
- Boxes for fragile items
- No basements or attics (temperature/humidity vary)

**Handling:**
- Clean, dry hands
- Support book spine
- Turn pages carefully
- Don't eat/drink near books
- Use bookmarks, not folding corners

**Pest Control:**
- Cedar shelving (repels insects)
- Regular inspection
- Remove infested items immediately
- Freezing kills insects (if climate allows)

**Deacidification:**
- Alkaline wash can neutralize acid
- Soak pages in magnesium bicarbonate solution
- Raises pH, prevents further degradation
- Only for valuable items (labor-intensive)

**Copying:**
- Make multiple copies of important works
- Distribute widely
- If one decays, others survive
- This is the ultimate preservation

### Recopying Schedule

**Critical documents (this guide):**
- Inspect annually
- Recopy every 50 years
- Maintain 10+ copies in different locations

**Important documents:**
- Inspect every 5 years
- Recopy every 100 years
- Maintain 3+ copies

**General documents:**
- Inspect every 10 years
- Recopy when showing deterioration

## Troubleshooting Common Problems

### Paper Making Problems

**Problem: Weak, tears easily**
- **Cause**: Under-beaten fibers, insufficient cooking, wrong material
- **Fix**: Beat longer, cook material more thoroughly, use better source material (cotton/linen)

**Problem: Holes in sheet**
- **Cause**: Lumps in pulp, disturbed during forming, mold damaged
- **Fix**: Beat more thoroughly, gentler handling on mold, repair mold screen

**Problem: Uneven thickness**
- **Cause**: Uneven shake when forming, inconsistent pulp concentration, mold not level
- **Fix**: Practice forming technique, stir vat more, check mold for warping

**Problem: Won't release from mold (couching)**
- **Cause**: Pulp too wet, felts too dry, over-beaten pulp
- **Fix**: Press longer before couching, dampen felts slightly, reduce beating time

**Problem: Wavy, cockled paper when dry**
- **Cause**: Uneven drying, humid environment, tension during drying
- **Fix**: Better air circulation, dry in controlled environment, final pressing when dry

**Problem: Ink feathers/spreads (unsized)**
- **Cause**: No sizing or insufficient sizing
- **Fix**: Apply gelatin or starch sizing, ensure proper drying after sizing

**Problem: Brittle, cracks when folded**
- **Cause**: Over-beaten, too much sizing, aged paper
- **Fix**: Reduce beating time, less sizing chemical, ensure proper humidity storage

### Ink Problems

**Problem: Ink too thick, won't spread**
- **Cause**: Too much pigment, evaporation, cold temperature
- **Fix**: Add oil drop-by-drop, warm ink gently, store covered

**Problem: Ink too thin, runs**
- **Cause**: Too much oil, wrong oil type, too warm
- **Fix**: Evaporate on glass plate, add pigment, add thick varnish

**Problem: Ink doesn't dry**
- **Cause**: Too much oil, high humidity, non-drying oil used
- **Fix**: Add drying agent (lead oxide - CAREFUL, toxic), better ventilation, use boiled linseed oil

**Problem: Ink fades quickly**
- **Cause**: Poor pigment (not lightfast), thin application
- **Fix**: Use carbon black (permanent), increase ink opacity, avoid colored inks except iron gall

### Printing Problems

**Problem: Faint, incomplete impression**
- **Causes**: Insufficient pressure, too little ink, uneven type height, worn type
- **Fixes**: Increase press pressure, add more ink, check type-high gauge, replace worn type

**Problem: Smudged print**
- **Causes**: Too much ink, ink too thin, paper moved during impression
- **Fixes**: Reduce ink, thicken ink, secure paper better on tympan

**Problem: Uneven impression (some areas dark, some light)**
- **Causes**: Platen not parallel to bed, uneven type height, warped bed
- **Fixes**: Adjust platen screws for parallelism, underlays (paper packing) under low areas, true bed surface

**Problem: Offset (ink on back of next sheet)**
- **Causes**: Ink too wet, stacking too soon, too much ink
- **Fixes**: Let sheets dry before stacking, reduce ink, increase drying time

**Problem: Type breaks/cracks**
- **Causes**: Excessive pressure, brittle type metal, type-high error (high spot takes all pressure)
- **Fixes**: Reduce pressure, improve type metal alloy (add tin), level type carefully

**Problem: Ink fills in counters (centers of letters)**
- **Causes**: Ink too thin, too much ink, excessive pressure
- **Fixes**: Thicken ink, reduce ink amount, reduce pressure slightly

**Problem: Registration off (multi-color)**
- **Causes**: Paper size variation, humidity changes, guides shifted, inconsistent tympan
- **Fixes**: Acclimate paper to shop humidity, check/reset guides, tighten tympan hinge

### Type Casting Problems

**Problem: Type sticks in mold, won't release**
- **Causes**: Mold too hot, insufficient draft angle, rough mold interior
- **Fixes**: Let mold cool slightly between casts, polish mold interior, oil lightly

**Problem: Incomplete casting (short type, missing parts)**
- **Causes**: Metal not hot enough, mold not closed firmly, air trapped
- **Fixes**: Increase metal temperature, check mold closure/spring, pour quickly and decisively

**Problem: Type not square (leans)**
- **Causes**: Mold faces not parallel, worn hinge, matrix not seated properly
- **Fixes**: True mold faces, replace hinge, check matrix seating before each cast

**Problem: Inconsistent type height**
- **Causes**: Matrix moves during casting, mold cavity depth varies
- **Fixes**: Secure matrix better, check mold for wear, measure and reject out-of-spec type

**Problem: Rough, pitted surface on type**
- **Causes**: Oxidized metal (dross), mold too cold, impurities in metal
- **Fixes**: Skim dross from molten metal, preheat mold slightly, use cleaner metal

### Press Mechanical Problems

**Problem: Platen won't lower evenly**
- **Causes**: Bent screw, damaged threads, uneven wear
- **Fixes**: Straighten or replace screw, re-cut threads, shim to compensate

**Problem: Bed won't slide smoothly**
- **Causes**: Rails dirty/rusty, bed warped, insufficient lubrication
- **Fixes**: Clean and oil rails, true bed surface, regular lubrication (see Chapter 2.8)

**Problem: Frame creaks/flexes under pressure**
- **Causes**: Joints loosening, insufficient bracing, wood frame inadequate
- **Fixes**: Tighten bolts, add diagonal bracing, reinforce or replace with stronger frame

**Problem: Press bar too hard to pull**
- **Causes**: Excessive pressure setting, mechanical friction, screw binding
- **Fixes**: Reduce pressure (add packing instead), lubricate screw, check for binding points

### Material Sourcing Problems

**Problem: Can't find suitable rags**
- **Alternatives**: Old cotton clothing, linen textiles, hemp rope (unraveled), paper recycling

**Problem: No carbon black for ink**
- **Alternatives**: Collect lampblack from oil lamps, burn pine wood for soot, char bones (bone black)

**Problem: No gelatin for sizing**
- **Alternatives**: Starch sizing (wheat, rice, corn), egg white, animal hide glue, plant mucilages

**Problem: No linseed oil for ink**
- **Alternatives**: Walnut oil, poppy seed oil, sunflower oil (all less ideal but workable)

**Problem: Can't cast metal type (no foundry)**
- **Alternatives**: Carved wooden type (large sizes), carved linoleum blocks, hand-lettering

### General Troubleshooting Approach

1. **Identify symptoms precisely**: Not "bad print" but "light impression on left side"
2. **Isolate variable**: Change one thing at a time
3. **Test systematically**: Make test prints between each adjustment
4. **Keep records**: Note what works and what doesn't
5. **Learn from others**: Apprenticeship and knowledge sharing critical

**When to Ask for Help:**
- Persistent problems despite multiple fixes attempted
- Safety concerns (structural press failure, chemical hazards)
- Specialized knowledge needed (metallurgy, precision machining)

**Prevention Better Than Cure:**
- Regular maintenance (clean, oil, inspect)
- Quality materials (good paper stock, proper ink, tested type metal)
- Proper technique (learned through practice and instruction)
- Document successful processes (write down what works)

**Simple block printing:** + 2-4 weeks (carving blocks)
**Full printing press:** + 3-6 months (building press, casting type)
**Complete print shop:** + 1-2 years (all operations optimized, trained staff)

**Budget Reality Check:**

Even "salvage everything" approach requires:
- Months of dedicated labor (2-4 people)
- Metalworking capability (for press, type mold)
- Chemistry knowledge (ink, sizing, paper processing)
- Woodworking skill (press frame, furniture, cases)

**Start small. Master paper first. Add printing capability as resources allow.**

**Absolute Bare Minimum (Emergency Knowledge Preservation):**

If civilization has just collapsed and you have NOTHING:
1. Make charcoal (burn wood in low oxygen)
2. Grind charcoal to powder
3. Mix with plant sap or egg white = crude ink
4. Write on salvaged paper, bark, or thin wood
5. Store in dry place
6. **This preserves knowledge until proper paper/printing can be established**

- Metal for type (scavenge lead, tin)
- Time investment is largest cost

**Operating Costs:**
- Paper materials (renewable)
- Ink materials (ongoing)
- Type metal (recyclable)
- Labor
- Facility

**Revenue:**
- Printed books
- Newspapers/bulletins
- Official documents

## Priority Printing Sequence

**When you establish printing capability, print in this order:**

### Priority 1: This Guide
**"Rebuilding Technology"**

- Print complete, both volumes if split
- Minimum 10 copies immediately
- 100 copies within first year
- Distribute widely (different communities)
- Never let fewer than 10 copies exist

**Why first:**
- Contains all other knowledge needed
- Self-referential (includes printing instructions)
- Loss would be catastrophic
- Foundation for all other rebuilding

### Priority 2: Critical Knowledge
**Immediate survival and foundational technologies:**

- Medical knowledge (basic treatments, surgery, sanitation)
- Agriculture (crop cultivation, preservation, animal husbandry)
- Water purification and sanitation
- Basic chemistry and metallurgy
- Mathematics (essential calculations)

**Why second:**
- Saves lives immediately
- Enables food production
- Prevents disease
- Supports other technologies

### Priority 3: Reference Works
**Core knowledge base:**

- Dictionary (language preservation)
- Mathematical tables
- Measurement standards
- Chemical reference
- Botanical identification
- Medical reference

**Why third:**
- Used constantly
- Cannot be easily remembered
- Standards must be preserved exactly
- Reference, not readable cover-to-cover

### Priority 4: Educational Materials
**Training next generation:**

- Basic literacy texts
- Mathematics primers
- Science fundamentals
- Technical training manuals
- Historical knowledge (so we don't repeat mistakes)

**Why fourth:**
- Children must be educated
- Knowledge transfer across generations
- Society advancement depends on education

### Priority 5: Cultural Works
**Humanities and culture:**

- Literature (morale matters)
- History
- Philosophy
- Arts and music

**Why fifth:**
- Not immediately survival-critical
- But necessary for civilization
- Morale and hope matter
- "Man does not live by bread alone"

### Distribution Strategy

**Geographic Dispersal:**
- Never keep all copies in one place
- Minimum 100 miles between major caches
- Different climate zones (fire/flood protection)
- Different political regions (war protection)

**Institutional Placement:**
- Schools (will use and maintain)
- Libraries (traditional keepers)
- Religious institutions (historically stable)
- Government (if trustworthy)
- Trade centers (wide distribution)

**Multiple Formats:**
- Print on best available paper
- If possible, create microfilm (very compact)
- Create abbreviated versions (quicker to copy)
- Illustrated summaries (for wider accessibility)

**Verification:**
- Send someone to verify copies exist
- Annual check-in system
- Replace missing/damaged copies immediately

## Final Critical Instructions

**You, the reader of this chapter, now have the knowledge to:**

1. Make paper from plant fibers
2. Create permanent ink
3. Build writing implements
4. Construct a printing press
5. Cast metal type
6. Print hundreds of copies
7. Bind books that will last centuries
8. Preserve knowledge for future generations

**Your duty is clear:**

**COPY THIS GUIDE.**

Do not wait. Do not assume someone else will do it. Do not assume printed copies exist elsewhere. Every day without copies is a day where human knowledge is one disaster away from extinction.

Start with paper. Even crude paper is better than none. Make ink from soot and glue if you must. Carve wooden type if you cannot cast metal. Hand-copy if you have no other option.

But COPY THIS GUIDE.

Distribute copies. Teach others to make paper and print. Establish print shops in every community. Make knowledge preservation your civilization's highest non-survival priority.

Books can outlive empires. The knowledge in this guide can rebuild civilization. But only if it survives.

The future is in your hands. Literally. These pages, this information, these techniques.

Copy them. Preserve them. Spread them.

Humanity is counting on you.
