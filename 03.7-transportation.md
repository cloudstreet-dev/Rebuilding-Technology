# 3.7 Transportation

## Why Transportation Matters

In the aftermath of collapse, transportation becomes the lifeline connecting scattered survivors into functioning communities. Without it, you're limited to what you can carry on your back and what resources exist within walking distance. Transportation enables trade networks that distribute surpluses and fill shortages. It allows knowledge sharing between communities—techniques for iron smelting, crop varieties that thrive in local conditions, warnings about approaching dangers. It extends your resource gathering range, letting you access deposits of clay, iron ore, or timber that might be miles away.

The difference between isolated survival and rebuilding civilization lies in your ability to move goods and people. A community that can transport grain becomes a breadbasket. One that can move ore and fuel can establish industry. Transportation allows specialists to emerge—the blacksmith who serves five villages, the teacher who circuits between settlements, the trader who knows what each community needs and produces.

Start simple and progress methodically. Human-powered transport comes first, then animal-powered, then waterways. Each step multiplies your capabilities. A person can carry 50 pounds on foot. A bicycle extends that to 20 miles with less effort. A horse-drawn cart moves 500 pounds. A wagon can carry a ton. A riverboat can transport 20 tons. Each advancement opens new possibilities.

## Human-Powered Transport

### Bicycles: The Efficiency Multiplier

A bicycle is perhaps the most efficient machine ever invented. It multiplies human travel speed by three while actually reducing energy expenditure compared to walking. For carrying loads, a bicycle with panniers can transport 40-60 pounds over distances that would exhaust someone carrying half that weight.

**Salvaging Bicycles**

In the early years, salvage provides your bicycle fleet. Look for bikes in garages, bike shops, apartment buildings, and university campuses. Prioritize:

- Steel-frame bikes over aluminum (easier to repair through welding)
- Simple designs over complex (fewer parts to fail)
- Mountain bikes or touring bikes over road bikes (stronger, more versatile)
- Hub gears over derailleurs (more reliable, less maintenance)

Immediately remove tires from salvaged bikes and store them inflated in cool, dark conditions. Rubber degrades from UV exposure and ozone. Tires are the most finite resource in bicycle maintenance—once you exhaust salvage supplies, manufacturing replacement tires requires rubber tree cultivation or extensive chemical processing.

**Bicycle Repair**

Most bicycle repairs require only basic tools: wrenches, screwdrivers, a chain tool, and tire levers. Establish a community bicycle workshop where knowledge and tools can be shared.

Common repairs include:

*Flat tires*: Patch kits work for inner tubes. A rubber patch, rubber cement, and rough sandpaper fix most flats. To extend patch kit supplies, make patches from old inner tubes using the remaining glue. In the absence of patch kits, wrap the tube in cloth at the puncture point, bind it tightly with wire, and reinflate carefully—a temporary fix for emergency travel.

*Chain maintenance*: Clean chains with kerosene or alcohol. Lubricate with any oil—motor oil, vegetable oil, animal fat. Chains stretch over time. Measure with a ruler: 12 links should span exactly 12 inches. At 12-1/8 inches, replace the chain to prevent sprocket wear.

*Brake systems*: Rim brakes work until brake pads wear out. Leather can substitute for rubber brake pads temporarily. Adjust brake cable tension using barrel adjusters. When cables fray, unwind them and retie using the remaining strands, or manufacture replacement cables from piano wire if available.

*Bearing maintenance*: Hubs, bottom brackets, and headsets contain ball bearings in grease. Disassemble annually, clean bearings in solvent, inspect for pitting, repack with grease. If bearings are unavailable, turn down replacement balls on a lathe from steel stock, though precision requirements are high.

**Manufacturing Bicycles**

Bicycle manufacture is surprisingly complex. The diamond frame design is efficient but requires precise tube mitering and brazing. The wheels present the greatest challenge—achieving proper spoke tension and true alignment requires skill.

*Frame construction*: Steel tubing (1-1.5 inches diameter, 0.035-0.065 inches wall thickness) works for frames. Chrome-moly steel is ideal but plain high-carbon steel functions adequately. Cut tubes to length with a hacksaw. Miter the ends to fit tube junctions at proper angles—this requires careful filing or a dedicated tube miter jig. Braze or weld joints. Silver brazing works well for thin-wall tubing. If welding, use TIG to prevent burn-through.

The critical measurements:
- Seat tube: 18-22 inches (depending on rider height)
- Top tube: 20-24 inches
- Head angle: 72-74 degrees
- Seat angle: 73-75 degrees
- Chainstay length: 16-17 inches

*Wheel building*: This is an art. You need perfectly round rims, uniform spokes, and proper hubs. For a 36-spoke wheel (standard), you'll lace spokes in a three-cross pattern. Thread each spoke through the hub flange, cross it over three other spokes, and insert into the rim. Tension gradually, working around the wheel in quarters. True the wheel by adjusting spoke tension—tighten spokes toward the high side to pull the rim over. Final tension should be high enough that you can barely deflect spokes by squeezing pairs together.

Manufacture spokes from wire (14 gauge steel wire, approximately 2mm diameter). Thread both ends—one end with a spoke nipple thread, the other with a head formed by upsetting the wire in a forge. This requires a spoke threading die and heading die.

Rims can be rolled from steel strip, welded into a circle, and drilled for spoke holes. Achieving perfect roundness is difficult. Wooden rims can work for low-speed applications but lack durability.

*Chains and gears*: Chain manufacture requires precision machining beyond most early workshops. Salvage and preserve chains carefully. Sprockets can be cut from steel plate on a mill, though you need careful tooth profile work.

*Practical timeline*: In Year 1-2, rely entirely on salvage and repair. In Year 3-5, begin manufacturing simple frames for replacement. Wheels remain largely salvage-dependent for 5-10 years. Only established workshops with precision tools can manufacture chains and bearings.

### Carts and Wheelbarrows

A wheelbarrow multiplies human carrying capacity fivefold. A person who can carry 50 pounds can push 250 pounds in a wheelbarrow. Two-wheeled carts extend this further.

**Wheelbarrow Construction**

The simplest wheelbarrow uses:
- A wheel (bicycle wheel, hand-cut wooden wheel, or salvaged wheel from lawn equipment)
- Two handles (ash, oak, or hickory wood, 5 feet long, 1.5 inches diameter)
- A bed (wooden box or metal bin)
- Braces connecting handles to bed

Cut handles from straight-grained hardwood. They must withstand flexing under load. Shape the gripping ends comfortably. The wheel mounts at the forward end where handles converge. Create an axle from 1/2-inch steel rod passing through both handles. The wheel spins on this axle. Mount the bed 12-18 inches behind the wheel, secured to both handles with bolts or strong joinery.

The bed can be a simple wooden box (12 inches deep, 18 inches wide, 24 inches long) made from 3/4-inch boards. Or form a metal bin from salvaged sheet metal. Angled sides help with dumping loads.

Critical ratios: The distance from handles to wheel should be approximately 1/3 the total handle length. This provides mechanical advantage—you lift only about 40% of the load weight while the wheel supports the rest.

**Two-Wheeled Carts**

A two-wheeled cart balances on its axle, with the human providing stability and motive force. This design can carry 200-400 pounds depending on construction.

Build a rectangular frame (4 feet long, 3 feet wide) from 2x4 lumber or welded steel tubing. Mount wheels on an axle beneath this frame. Extend two pulling shafts forward from the frame. These shafts rest on the ground when parked and lift to waist height when pulled.

Bicycle wheels work for light carts. For heavy loads, use larger wheels (20-26 inch diameter) salvaged from hand trucks, lawn equipment, or early manufacture. The axle must be sturdy—3/4 inch steel rod minimum, 1 inch preferred. It passes through both sides of the frame and through the wheel hubs.

Add a bed to the frame. Wooden slats work for most purposes. Incorporate stakes at corners to contain loads. If transporting liquids, seal the bed with pitch or line with salvaged plastic sheeting.

**Human-Powered Vehicles Beyond Bicycles**

Cargo tricycles with large front bins can carry 100-150 pounds. Bicycle trailers extend capacity further. Multi-person vehicles like bicycle rickshaws provide passenger transport. Each design trades efficiency for capacity.

For specialized needs, consider:
- Hand carts with four wheels for very heavy loads (500+ pounds)
- Stretcher-style carriers for the injured (requires two carriers)
- Pack frames for foot travel in rough terrain where wheels don't function

## Animal-Powered Transport

### Draft Animals

Animals transform transportation. A single horse can pull a ton. A team of oxen can move three tons. This isn't just quantitative improvement—it's qualitative. Distances that were impassable on foot become accessible. Trade routes extend from neighboring villages to regional networks.

**Horses**

Horses move faster than oxen (walking speed 4 mph vs 2 mph) but require more care and better feed. They're intelligent, trainable, but skittish. A horse can pull approximately 8 times its body weight on wheels, 1/10th that in a dragged load.

For draft purposes, seek heavy breeds if possible: draft horses, draft crosses, or sturdy quarter horses. These have the temperament and build for pulling. Avoid hot-blooded breeds (thoroughbreds, Arabians) for draft work—they lack the calm needed for steady pulling.

A working horse needs 15-25 pounds of feed daily—hay plus grain. This is significant. One horse requires 3-4 acres of dedicated cropland or pasture. Consider this when deciding herd size.

Training a horse to pull requires patience. Start with a trained animal if possible—they'll teach others by example. If training from scratch:
1. Accustom the horse to the harness (let them wear it while walking, no pulling yet)
2. Attach lightweight dragging items (small logs, empty sledges)
3. Gradually increase weight
4. Introduce the cart or wagon with help from an experienced animal
5. Practice starts, stops, turns, and backing up

**Oxen**

Oxen are castrated cattle trained for draft work. They're slower than horses but stronger relative to size, calmer, and less demanding of feed quality. Oxen can subsist on rougher forage. They also serve as emergency food in crisis—horses are less practical as food animals.

A team of oxen (two animals) can pull 2-3 tons on a wheeled vehicle. They work in yokes, with the weight distributed across their shoulders. Oxen respond to voice commands more than rein control.

Training oxen starts young (1-2 years old). Pair them early and keep pairs together—they learn to move as a unit. Basic commands: "Get up" (go), "Whoa" (stop), "Gee" (turn right), "Haw" (turn left), "Back" (reverse). Use consistent voice tones. Guide with a light touch using a stick, never through force.

**Mules and Donkeys**

Mules (horse-donkey hybrids) combine advantages: stronger than horses, less food than horses, more intelligent than either parent. They're sterile, so you need access to both horses and donkeys for breeding. Mules are excellent for rough terrain and have legendary endurance.

Donkeys themselves work well for light draft and pack work. A donkey can carry 100-150 pounds of pack load and walk all day. In arid regions, donkeys outperform horses.

### Harness Making

Animals need harnesses to transfer pulling force to vehicles without injury. Poor harness design cripples animals.

**Collar Harness (for horses/mules)**

A collar harness distributes force across the shoulders and chest. The collar is a padded oval that sits on the shoulders. Traces (strong straps) connect the collar to the vehicle.

Construction:
1. Shape a collar foundation from wood bent into an oval (20-24 inch tall, 18-20 inch wide at base). Steam-bend ash or oak.
2. Pad the inside with straw or foam wrapped in leather or canvas. Padding should be 2-3 inches thick where it contacts the animal.
3. Cover the outside with leather, stitched firmly.
4. Attach hames (metal or wood pieces) to the collar sides. These provide attachment points for traces.
5. Create traces from 2-inch wide leather straps or woven plant fiber reinforced with leather. They must withstand thousands of pounds of tension.
6. Add a back strap connecting collar to crupper (tail strap) to keep the harness positioned.

The collar must fit the specific animal. Too tight causes sores. Too loose shifts and rubs.

**Yoke (for oxen)**

Oxen use yokes rather than collars. A yoke is a wooden beam that rests on the necks of two oxen.

Cut a yoke from a solid timber 6-8 feet long (depending on ox size), 4-6 inches thick. Carve two shallow depressions where ox necks will sit. These curves should match the animal's neck shape. Drill holes below each depression for bows—these are U-shaped pieces that pass under the ox neck and pin into the yoke, securing the animal.

Bows can be formed from steamed hickory or ash bent into a U, or forged from iron. They need quick-release pins so oxen can be freed quickly if needed.

Attach a chain or beam to the center of the yoke for pulling. The yoke distributes force across both animals' shoulders evenly.

**Materials and Maintenance**

Leather is the traditional harness material. It's strong, flexible, and repairable. Treat leather with neat's-foot oil or animal fats to keep it supple. Inspect harnesses weekly for cracking or wear.

In leather scarcity, substitute:
- Woven plant fiber (hemp, flax) for non-critical straps
- Rawhide for high-strength components
- Canvas or heavy cloth for padding
- Chain for traces (less comfortable but durable)

### Carts and Wagons

**Basic Cart Design**

A two-wheeled cart for a single animal (horse or pair of oxen):
- Shafts extending forward for animal harness attachment
- Axle supporting wheels (4-5 feet diameter preferred)
- Bed for cargo (4 feet x 6 feet typical)
- Weight capacity: 500-1000 pounds

Build the undercarriage first. Create an axle from hardwood (oak, ash, hickory) or steel if available. Wood axles should be 3-4 inches diameter. Steel can be 1.5-2 inches. The axle mounts beneath the cart bed on axle beds—curved wooden or metal supports that hold it in place while allowing some flex.

Wheels present the main challenge. See the Wheels and Axles section for detailed construction. Mount wheels so they spin freely on the axle. Use iron sleeves or bushings at the hub. Lubricate with grease or tallow.

The bed frame uses 2x6 or larger timbers. Cross-bracing prevents racking. Floor the bed with planks. Add removable side and end boards to contain loads.

Shafts extend forward 8-10 feet. They must be strong—2x4 minimum, 3x4 better. The animal walks between these shafts. Connect shafts to harness traces.

**Four-Wheeled Wagons**

Wagons offer greater capacity (2-3 tons) and stability but require more skilled construction. The critical feature is the front axle must pivot for turning.

Build front and rear axles separately, each with wheels. Mount the rear axle rigidly to the wagon bed. Mount the front axle on a pivot pin (kingpin) that allows it to rotate 30-40 degrees to each side. This is mechanically complex—the kingpin must be very strong and well-supported.

A wagon bed typically measures 4 feet wide by 10-12 feet long. Use heavy timber framing (4x6 or larger). The box should be removable to allow specialized beds (flat for lumber, high-sided for grain, tanked for liquids).

Brake systems are essential for wagons. The simplest: a lever-operated wooden block that presses against a wheel rim. For longer trips, add a drag shoe—a piece of wood or metal that drops beneath a wheel to create friction against the ground.

### Care and Feeding of Draft Animals

A lame or sick animal stops being transportation and becomes a liability. Prevention through good care is essential.

**Daily Care**

Inspect hooves daily. Horses need hoof trimming every 6-8 weeks, shoes every 8-10 weeks if working on hard surfaces. Oxen have cloven hooves requiring similar attention. Learn to trim hooves yourself or establish a farrier in your community.

Clean harness contact points on the animal's body. Sweat and dirt under harnesses cause sores that can disable an animal for weeks. Brush animals after work to remove sweat and prevent skin problems.

Provide water freely. A working horse drinks 10-12 gallons daily, more in hot weather. Oxen need similar amounts. Dehydration kills quickly.

**Feeding**

Draft animals need:
- Roughage (hay, straw, pasture grass): 2-3% of body weight daily
- Grain (oats, barley, corn): for working animals, 0.5-1% of body weight daily
- Salt: free-choice access to salt licks
- Minerals: varied diet usually provides these, or supplement with bone meal

A 1200-pound horse eats 24-36 pounds of roughage plus 6-12 pounds of grain daily when working. When idle, reduce grain. Overfeeding idle animals causes health problems.

Spread feeding throughout the day rather than one large meal. Animals have small stomachs relative to body size.

**Health Issues**

Colic (digestive upset) is common and dangerous. Symptoms include refusing food, pawing, looking at flanks, lying down repeatedly. Prevent through gradual diet changes, regular feeding schedule, and good feed quality. Treatment requires walking the animal and sometimes medication—establish contact with anyone who has veterinary knowledge.

Lameness has many causes: stone bruises, infections, improper shoeing, joint problems. Rest lame animals immediately. Continuing to work a lame animal often turns a minor issue into permanent disability.

External parasites (lice, mites, flies) irritate animals and spread disease. Control through cleanliness, manure management, and herbal repellents (wormwood, tansy, eucalyptus oils if available).

## Water Transport

Water is the ancient highway. Rivers and coastlines permit movement of massive loads with minimal effort. A single person poling a raft can move what would require a wagon train on land.

### Boats and Rafts

**Raft Construction**

The simplest watercraft is a raft of logs. Gather straight logs (8-16 inches diameter, 10-15 feet long). Cedar, pine, and other softwoods float better than hardwoods. Lay logs parallel. Lash them together with rope or secure with wooden cross-pieces.

A basic raft:
- 6-8 logs (12 feet long)
- Cross-pieces (top and bottom) bolted or pegged through logs
- Decking (planks laid across top) optional but useful

This raft floats 4-6 people plus cargo. Control with poles in shallow water (push against the bottom) or oars/paddles in deep water. Rafts don't track well—they rotate and drift. Use them for downstream travel or crossing, not for precise navigation.

Improve raft design:
- Taper the front to reduce water resistance
- Add raised sides to keep water out
- Include a shelter platform for weather protection
- Attach a rudder for directional control

**Dugout Canoes**

A dugout canoe carved from a single log combines light weight, durability, and good handling. Select a large, straight tree (cedar, pine, cottonwood—soft woods carve easier). 15-20 feet length, 2-3 feet diameter minimum.

Construction process:
1. Fell the tree and remove branches
2. Shape the exterior to a canoe profile (pointed ends, rounded bottom)
3. Hollow the interior using fire and adze work
   - Build small fires along the top to char wood
   - Scrape out charred wood with an adze
   - Repeat until walls are 1-2 inches thick
4. Smooth the interior with scrapers and sand
5. Seal any cracks with pitch

This requires weeks of work but produces a boat that lasts decades. A 15-foot dugout carries 2-3 people plus 300-400 pounds of cargo.

**Plank Boats**

Plank construction allows larger, more sophisticated boats but requires more skill and materials.

The simplest plank boat is a flat-bottomed skiff. Build it like a wooden box:
- Bottom: planks (1 inch thick, 12 inches wide) laid side-by-side, 10-14 feet long
- Sides: planks (3/4 inch thick, 12-18 inches tall) attached to bottom edges
- Ends: triangular pieces closing the box
- Frames: ribs inside providing shape and strength
- Seats: cross-members for rowers

Join planks edge-to-edge. Traditional methods:
- Overlap planks (clinker/lapstrake): upper plank overlaps lower, secured with copper nails clenched over roves (washers)
- Edge-to-edge (carvel): planks meet at edges, caulk seams with oakum (tarred hemp fibers) and seal with pitch

Waterproofing is critical. Caulk all seams thoroughly. Apply pitch or tar to the entire exterior. Inspect regularly and re-caulk as needed.

**Sails**

Wind power multiplies water transport effectiveness. A simple square sail catches wind from behind. More sophisticated rigs allow sailing at angles to the wind.

Make sails from:
- Canvas (if salvageable)
- Woven plant fiber (hemp, flax)
- Leather (for small sails)

A square sail for a small boat:
- Fabric: 8 feet tall, 10 feet wide
- Top spar: wooden pole holding the top edge
- Bottom spar or loose foot: holds shape at bottom
- Mast: vertical pole stepping into boat bottom
- Rigging: ropes to raise, lower, and control the sail

Sailing requires skill. Practice in safe conditions. Understand basic principles:
- Wind pushes the sail, boat moves perpendicular to the wind direction (with proper sail angle)
- Keel or centerboard prevents sideways drift
- Rudder controls direction
- Reefing (reducing sail area) necessary in strong wind

### Navigation

**Maps**

Create regional maps immediately. Accurate maps are strategic assets. Document:
- Waterways (rivers, streams, lakes)
- Coastlines
- Landmarks (mountains, distinctive trees, ruins)
- Settlements
- Resources (clay deposits, iron outcroppings, good timber stands)
- Distances (measured in travel time)

Survey methods without modern tools:
- Pace counting: measure your stride, count paces, calculate distance
- Dead reckoning: track direction and distance traveled from a known point
- Triangulation: locate positions by angles from known landmarks
- Celestial observation: latitude from sun angle at noon

Draw maps on paper, cloth, or leather. Include scale information. Copy maps—losing the only regional map is catastrophic.

**Compass**

A magnetic compass provides consistent directional reference. Manufacture a simple compass:

1. Magnetize a needle by stroking it repeatedly with a magnet (salvage magnets from speakers, motors)
2. Float the needle on water (stick it through cork or lay on leaf)
3. The needle aligns north-south

Permanent compass: Mount the magnetized needle on a pivot in a sealed container. Mark cardinal directions on the container. Protect from hard impacts that can demagnetize the needle.

Compass variation: Magnetic north differs from true north by varying amounts depending on location. Determine local variation by comparing compass reading to known north (Polaris at night, sun at noon).

**Celestial Navigation**

The sun and stars provide navigational information without any tools.

*Finding north*:
- Night: Locate Polaris (North Star) by following the pointer stars of the Big Dipper
- Day: Plant a vertical stick, mark shadow tip position at two times 30+ minutes apart, draw line between marks—this runs east-west

*Determining latitude*:
Measure the angle of Polaris above the horizon. This angle equals your latitude. Without tools, estimate by hand-widths (each hand-width at arm's length is approximately 10 degrees). At 45 degrees north latitude, Polaris appears about 4.5 hand-widths above the horizon.

*Time and longitude*:
Without accurate clocks, longitude determination is impractical. Rely on dead reckoning and landmark navigation.

### River and Coastal Travel

**River Navigation**

Rivers flow one direction. Use this. Float downstream with the current (potentially with minimal effort). Travel upstream requires poling, rowing, sailing, or towing.

Techniques for upstream travel:
- Poling: Push against river bottom with long poles (works in shallow water)
- Rowing: Powerful but exhausting over long distances
- Sail: If wind direction cooperates
- Towing: Walk along shore pulling the boat with ropes (slow but effective)

River hazards:
- Rapids: Fast water over rocks. Scout before running. Often better to portage (carry boat around)
- Snags: Submerged logs can hole a boat
- Low bridges: May require unstepping mast or portaging
- Waterfalls: Portage mandatory

**Coastal Travel**

Coastlines offer long-distance travel routes but present different hazards than rivers.

Tidal awareness is essential. Learn local tide patterns. High tide floods areas that are dry at low tide. Strong tidal currents in narrow passages can overwhelm small boats.

Weather watching: Sea conditions change faster than rivers. Morning calm can become afternoon storm. Learn to read clouds and wind patterns. Avoid open water in threatening weather.

Stay close to shore in small boats. You want the option to beach quickly if conditions deteriorate. Travel during calm periods (often early morning).

## Roads and Bridges

### Road Maintenance

Existing paved roads will degrade but remain useful for years. Prioritize maintaining critical routes between communities.

**Pothole Repair**

Water infiltrates cracks, freezes, expands, and breaks pavement. Small cracks become potholes. Repair process:
1. Clear debris from the hole
2. Cut the hole to vertical edges (remove loose material)
3. Fill with compacted gravel or crushed stone
4. Top with salvaged asphalt (melt and pour) or tar-mixed gravel
5. Compact firmly

Without modern materials, pack holes with stone and gravel. It requires frequent re-packing but maintains passability.

**Drainage**

Water is the enemy of roads. Maintain drainage ditches alongside roads. Clear culverts and drains regularly. Water crossing the road surface erodes it quickly.

Re-establish crown (center higher than edges) on flat sections. This sheds water to the sides. Use a blade or scraper to reshape dirt roads.

**Surface Renewal**

Unpaved roads need regular grading and gravel addition. Once or twice yearly, drag a road with a heavy log or blade to smooth ruts and redistribute material. Add gravel to worn areas.

For heavily-used routes, consider corduroy roads: logs laid perpendicular to traffic direction. This works in muddy conditions where conventional surfaces fail. Lay logs tightly side-by-side, secured with stakes or cross-pieces.

### Bridge Construction

**Log Bridges**

For streams up to 20 feet wide, lay logs across.

Simple method:
- Fell trees 25-30 feet long, 12+ inches diameter
- Lay 3-4 logs parallel across the gap
- Secure with stakes driven into ground at each end
- Add cross-planking for walking/cart surface

Improve by notching logs into sill beams on each bank. This prevents shifting.

**Trestle Bridges**

For wider spans or higher crossings, build a trestle: an elevated framework.

Components:
- Sills: beams resting on ground/rock foundations at each end
- Bents: vertical frames supporting the bridge deck (like sawhorses)
- Stringers: longitudinal beams running the bridge length, resting on bents
- Decking: cross-planks providing the surface

A bent consists of vertical posts (4x6 or larger) with cross-bracing. Space bents 10-15 feet apart. Make them progressively taller to match terrain height as needed.

Critical: Foundation stability. On solid ground, bury posts 3-4 feet deep. In soft ground or water, drive sharpened posts deeper or add footings (flat stones, timbers).

**Suspension Bridges**

For very wide spans, suspension bridges offer solutions. These require significant engineering skill.

Basic principle: Cables or ropes strung across the gap support a walking deck via vertical hangers. The cables anchor firmly on both sides, ideally to bedrock or massive timber frameworks buried and weighted with stones.

Manufacture cable from:
- Salvaged steel cable (ideal)
- Woven plant fiber rope (hemp, flax) twisted into heavy cables
- Chain (if metalworking capability exists)

Build conservatively. Suspension bridges can fail catastrophically if poorly designed. Start with small foot bridges before attempting vehicle-capable spans.

## Wheels and Axles

The wheel seems simple but is mechanically complex to manufacture well. A poor wheel fails quickly under load.

### Wheel Design

A wheel needs:
- Hub: central cylinder containing the axle bearing
- Spokes: transfer load from hub to rim
- Rim: circular outer section that contacts ground or tire
- Tire: outer surface (optional but beneficial)

**Solid Wooden Wheels**

Cut a disc from a thick plank or glue-up of planks. This works for small, light-duty applications (wheelbarrows, handcarts). Solid wheels are heavy and crack along the grain. Improve by cutting from cross-grain sections (like cutting a log into wheels), but wood movement still causes problems.

**Spoked Wheels**

Spokes reduce weight while maintaining strength. This is traditional wagon wheel design.

Construction:
1. *Hub*: Turn a cylinder (8-10 inches diameter, 6-8 inches long) from hardwood on a lathe. Bore a central hole for the axle (tight fit). Drill holes around the perimeter for spoke mortises.

2. *Spokes*: Cut 12-16 spokes from straight-grained hardwood (oak, ash, hickory). They should be 1.5-2 inches diameter at the hub end, tapering to 1-1.5 inches at rim end. Length depends on wheel diameter (12-16 inches for typical spokes in a 4-foot wheel).

3. *Felloes* (rim sections): Cut 6-8 curved sections that assemble into a circle. Steam-bend or cut from curved wood. Each felloe has mortises for spoke ends.

4. *Assembly*:
   - Insert spokes into hub mortises (glued and wedged)
   - Insert spoke outer ends into felloe mortises
   - Assemble felloes into complete rim
   - Drive wheelwright's dowels through felloe joints
   - Shrink iron tire onto rim (see below)

**Iron Tires**

An iron band around the rim protects wood and holds felloes together. Forge a band slightly smaller diameter than the wooden rim. Heat to red heat. While hot, mount on the rim and rapidly cool with water. The iron shrinks, gripping the wood tightly. This requires quick work and assistance—the hot iron is dangerous and the window for mounting is brief.

Without smithing capability, wrap the rim with multiple layers of salvaged metal strapping or heavy wire. Less effective but better than bare wood.

### Axles and Bearings

The axle passes through the wheel hub. The interface must allow rotation with minimal friction while supporting heavy loads.

**Fixed Axle Design**

The axle doesn't rotate; the wheels spin around it. This is simpler. The axle is a stationary beam. Wheels mount on the axle ends via hub bearings.

Bearing options:
- Wood-on-wood: Hub bore slightly larger than axle, lubricated with grease/tallow. Works but wears quickly.
- Metal sleeve bearing: Press iron or brass sleeves into hub bore. Less friction, longer life.
- Ball bearings: Salvaged ball bearings are gold. Install carefully and protect from dirt.

**Rotating Axle Design**

The axle and wheels rotate together. The axle spins in bearings mounted to the vehicle frame. This is mechanically simpler at the wheel (axle fixed to hub) but requires good bearings where axle meets frame.

Lubrication is essential. Wooden bearings need daily greasing. Metal bearings need less frequent but regular lubrication. Without grease, bearings overheat and seize.

Make grease from animal fats. Tallow (rendered animal fat) works adequately. Mix with vegetable oils for better performance at varying temperatures. In emergencies, use straight oil or even mud—something is better than nothing.

## Maintaining Salvaged Vehicles

Gasoline vehicles, electric vehicles, and other modern transport will function if maintained. Fuel is the limiting factor.

### Internal Combustion Engines

**If Fuel is Available**

Gasoline degrades over months. Diesel lasts longer (years if stored properly). Stabilized fuel lasts longest but eventually becomes unusable. Once salvage fuel is exhausted, vehicle operation depends on production.

Producing gasoline requires:
- Petroleum feedstock (crude oil or alternatives)
- Distillation equipment
- Understanding of fractional distillation
This is Tier 2-3 technology, possible but complex.

Ethanol (alcohol) can substitute for or extend gasoline. Produce ethanol via fermentation:
1. Ferment sugary or starchy material (grains, fruit, potatoes)
2. Distill to 95% alcohol content
3. Use pure or blend with gasoline (10-85% ethanol)

Most gasoline engines run on ethanol with minimal modification. Carburetors may need rejetting. Fuel lines must be ethanol-resistant (modern vehicles post-2000 usually are).

**Maintenance Priorities**

Oil changes: Engine oil degrades with use. Change every 3000-5000 miles, more frequently with poor oil quality. Manufacture oil from petroleum if available, or accept reduced engine life and frequent rebuild.

Filters: Air filters prevent engine wear. Clean and reuse foam filters. Replace paper filters or manufacture substitutes from cloth.

Cooling: Maintain coolant levels. Pure water works but causes corrosion and freezes. Antifreeze (ethylene glycol) is chemically complex to produce.

Tires: The ultimate consumable. Salvaged tires last years but eventually fail. Manufacture requires rubber (plantations or extensive chemistry) and sophisticated equipment. In tire scarcity, reduce vehicle use, drive slowly, maintain proper inflation, and develop alternatives (solid rubber or metal wheels for slow speeds).

**Strategic Value**

A single working truck can transform a community's capabilities. Haul tons of cargo. Transport the injured. Move building materials. Use it wisely—wear parts are irreplaceable long-term.

### Electric Vehicles

EVs have fewer moving parts than combustion engines. If you have electrical generation (solar, wind, hydro), EVs can operate indefinitely with less maintenance.

**Advantages**

- No fuel production needed beyond electricity
- Fewer fluids (no oil changes)
- Regenerative braking reduces wear

**Maintenance**

Battery health is critical. Lithium batteries degrade over time and cycles. Maintain charge between 20-80% when possible. Extreme temperatures accelerate degradation. Without replacement battery production (complex chemistry and manufacturing), each EV has finite life.

Tires and suspension wear the same as combustion vehicles.

Electrical system repairs require specialized knowledge. Establish at least one person in your community who understands high-voltage systems and EV architecture.

**Charging Infrastructure**

Solar panels can charge EVs directly via charge controllers. A modest solar array (4-6 kilowatts) can add significant daily range to an EV. Wind turbines work similarly.

Without grid power, charging is slower. Plan trips around charge times. An EV becomes a local vehicle, not long-distance transport, unless you establish charging networks.

## Steam Engines for Transport

Steam technology enables mechanized transport without petroleum. It requires metalworking and precision, but these are achievable with early industrial capabilities.

### Steam Engine Basics

Steam engines convert heat into motion:
1. Boil water to create steam (pressure)
2. Direct steam into cylinder with piston
3. Steam pressure pushes piston
4. Piston drives crankshaft (rotary motion)
5. Exhaust steam and repeat

Critical components:
- Boiler: Generates steam safely under pressure
- Cylinder and piston: Converts pressure to linear motion
- Valving: Controls steam flow timing
- Crankshaft: Converts linear to rotary motion

### Railroad Potential

Rails provide low-friction transport. A horse pulling a wagon moves 1-2 tons. That same horse pulling a rail car moves 5-10 tons. Replace the horse with a steam locomotive and move hundreds of tons.

**Rail Infrastructure**

Existing rail lines can be rehabilitated. Rails themselves last decades. Ties (sleepers) rot and need replacement. Wooden ties last 7-15 years depending on wood species and treatment. Manufacture replacement ties from durable woods (oak, cedar, locust) or salvage.

Switches and signals may be too complex to maintain without industrial support. Simplified systems work: manual switches, flag signals, scheduled runs preventing collisions.

**Locomotives**

Simple locomotives can be built with basic industrial capabilities:
- Boiler: Riveted steel tank rated for pressure (100-150 psi)
- Engine: Two or four cylinders driving wheels directly
- Cab and controls: Basic shelter and valves

This is advanced Tier 2 technology. You need:
- Iron/steel working
- Precision machining
- Boiler-making knowledge (failures kill)
- Understanding of thermodynamics

**Hand Cars and Velocipedes**

Before steam, human-powered rail vehicles provide immediate benefit. A hand car is a platform on rail wheels with a pump handle. Two people pumping can move at 10-15 mph carrying cargo. Build from salvaged rail wheels and simple framing.

### Stationary Steam Engines

Before mobile steam, use stationary engines for:
- Sawmills (cutting lumber faster)
- Grain mills (grinding via belt drive)
- Pumps (water for irrigation or mining)
- Workshop power (lathes, drills via line shafts)

A stationary engine is simpler than locomotive—no need to move the heavy boiler. This is a reasonable Tier 2 goal.

## Navigation and Mapping

Good navigation requires tools, knowledge, and practice.

### Surveying Without Modern Tools

**Distance Measurement**

- Pacing: Calibrate your stride (measure 100 feet precisely, count steps, calculate steps per mile). Experienced pacers achieve 2-3% accuracy.
- Chain or rope: Measure distance with known-length chain or rope (100 feet traditional). Lay repeatedly, mark positions.
- Odometer: Wheel of known circumference, count rotations. Build from salvaged bicycle wheel and a counting mechanism.

**Angle Measurement**

- Protractor: Salvage or manufacture from sheet material with degree markings
- Cross-staff: Two perpendicular sticks allow angle sighting
- Astrolabe: Measures angle of celestial objects above horizon

**Creating Maps**

Process for mapping unknown territory:
1. Choose origin point (established settlement)
2. Travel routes systematically, measuring distances and directions
3. Note landmarks, water features, terrain changes
4. Plot on paper using scale (e.g., 1 inch = 1 mile)
5. Fill in details with subsequent trips
6. Compare with others' observations, reconcile differences

Include practical information: travel times, water sources, hazards, resources.

### Communication and Signaling

Transportation networks need communication to coordinate.

**Visual Signals**

- Flags: Color-coded messages visible over distance
- Fires/smoke: Night fires or day smoke signals (agreed patterns convey messages)
- Heliograph: Reflect sunlight with mirror to flash messages (Morse code)

**Message Riders**

Establish message routes. Regular riders carry news, letters, and information between settlements. This creates information network alongside physical transport.

**Way Stations**

Every 20-30 miles along major routes, establish way stations: shelter, food, fresh horses/oxen. These enable long-distance travel by breaking journeys into stages.

This creates the foundation for larger-scale trade, knowledge exchange, and coordinated development. Transportation transforms isolated survival communities into the nodes of rebuilding civilization.

## Critical Success Factors

**Maintain Infrastructure**

Transport infrastructure degrades quickly without maintenance. Establish regular maintenance schedules and responsible parties. A washed-out bridge or impassable road breaks networks immediately.

**Document Knowledge**

Record construction techniques, routes, navigation information. Written instructions allow knowledge transfer. Don't let critical skills exist only in one person's memory.

**Start Simple, Progress Methodically**

Don't attempt complex projects before mastering basics. Walk before running. A fleet of wheelbarrows is more valuable early on than one sophisticated but unreliable wagon.

**Think in Networks**

Individual transport means are less valuable than coordinated networks. A road to nowhere helps no one. Plan routes connecting communities and resources.

**Balance Maintenance and New Construction**

Maintaining salvaged equipment and infrastructure is often easier than building new. But salvage is finite. Transition gradually toward manufactured replacements before salvage exhausts.

**Preserve Specialized Knowledge**

Vehicle mechanics, boat builders, farriers, wheelwrights, harness makers—these specialists are force multipliers. Ensure knowledge passes to apprentices.

## Conclusion

Transportation is civilization's circulatory system. It moves resources from source to need. It distributes surpluses and fills shortages. It allows specialization by connecting craftsmen with markets. It spreads knowledge by allowing teachers, books, and techniques to travel.

Begin with what you can do immediately: walk, bicycle, push carts. Progress to draft animals and wagons. Develop watercraft. Maintain roads. Each step multiplies capability. Each connection established makes both ends more valuable.

The community that establishes reliable transport first gains tremendous advantage. They access more resources. They know more (through contact with others). They trade more effectively. They attract specialists who need networks to serve multiple communities.

Transportation isn't glamorous. It's dirty work: maintaining harnesses, repairing wheels, clearing roads, dredging boat channels. But it's fundamental. Without it, you're limited to what one person can carry on their back. With it, you can rebuild the world.

Build your transportation systems methodically. Start now. Every cart built, every horse trained, every road cleared increases your community's resilience and potential. Transportation doesn't just move things—it moves you forward, from survival toward renewal.
