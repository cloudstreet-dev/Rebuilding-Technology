Transportation connects these technologies into a functional whole. No community rebuilds transport in isolation.

## Why Transportation Matters

In the aftermath of collapse, transportation becomes the lifeline connecting scattered survivors into functioning communities. Without it, you're limited to what you can carry on your back and what resources exist within walking distance. Transportation enables trade networks that distribute surpluses and fill shortages. It allows knowledge sharing between communities—techniques for iron smelting, crop varieties that thrive in local conditions, warnings about approaching dangers. It extends your resource gathering range, letting you access deposits of clay, iron ore, or timber that might be miles away.

The difference between isolated survival and rebuilding civilization lies in your ability to move goods and people. A community that can transport grain becomes a breadbasket. One that can move ore and fuel can establish industry. Transportation allows specialists to emerge—the blacksmith who serves five villages, the teacher who circuits between settlements, the trader who knows what each community needs and produces.

Start simple and progress methodically. Human-powered transport comes first, then animal-powered, then waterways. Each step multiplies your capabilities. A person can carry 50 pounds on foot. A bicycle extends that to 20 miles with less effort. A horse-drawn cart moves 500 pounds. A wagon can carry a ton. A riverboat can transport 20 tons. Each advancement opens new possibilities.

## Human-Powered Transport

### Bicycles: The Efficiency Multiplier

A bicycle is perhaps the most efficient machine ever invented. It multiplies human travel speed by three while actually reducing energy expenditure compared to walking. For carrying loads, a bicycle with panniers can transport 40-60 pounds over distances that would exhaust someone carrying half that weight.

**Salvaging Bicycles**

In the early years, salvage provides your bicycle fleet. Look for bikes in garages, bike shops, apartment buildings, and university campuses. Prioritize:

- Steel-frame bikes over aluminum (easier to repair through welding)
- Simple designs over complex (fewer parts to fail)
- Mountain bikes or touring bikes over road bikes (stronger, more versatile)
- Hub gears over derailleurs (more reliable, less maintenance)

Immediately remove tires from salvaged bikes and store them inflated in cool, dark conditions. Rubber degrades from UV exposure and ozone. Tires are the most finite resource in bicycle maintenance—once you exhaust salvage supplies, manufacturing replacement tires requires rubber tree cultivation or extensive chemical processing.

**Bicycle Repair**

Most bicycle repairs require only basic tools: wrenches, screwdrivers, a chain tool, and tire levers. Establish a community bicycle workshop where knowledge and tools can be shared.

Common repairs include:

*Flat tires*: Patch kits work for inner tubes. A rubber patch, rubber cement, and rough sandpaper fix most flats. To extend patch kit supplies, make patches from old inner tubes using the remaining glue. In the absence of patch kits, wrap the tube in cloth at the puncture point, bind it tightly with wire, and reinflate carefully—a temporary fix for emergency travel.

*Chain maintenance*: Clean chains with kerosene or alcohol. Lubricate with any oil—motor oil, vegetable oil, animal fat. Chains stretch over time. Measure with a ruler: place it so the ruler edge touches the center of one pin, then measure to the center of the 13th pin (covering 12 complete links)—this should measure exactly 12 inches. At 12-1/8 inches (1% stretch), replace the chain to prevent sprocket wear. Stretched chains wear sprockets rapidly, eventually causing skipping under load.

*Brake systems*: Rim brakes work until brake pads wear out. Leather can substitute for rubber brake pads temporarily. Adjust brake cable tension using barrel adjusters. When cables fray, unwind them and retie using the remaining strands, or manufacture replacement cables from piano wire if available.

*Bearing maintenance*: Hubs, bottom brackets, and headsets contain ball bearings in grease. Disassemble annually, clean bearings in solvent, inspect for pitting, repack with grease. If bearings are unavailable, turn down replacement balls on a lathe from steel stock, though precision requirements are high.

**Manufacturing Bicycles**

Bicycle manufacture is surprisingly complex. The diamond frame design is efficient but requires precise tube mitering and brazing. The wheels present the greatest challenge—achieving proper spoke tension and true alignment requires skill.

*Frame construction*: Steel tubing (1-1.5 inches diameter, 0.035-0.065 inches wall thickness) works for frames. Chrome-moly steel is ideal but plain high-carbon steel functions adequately. Cut tubes to length with a hacksaw. Miter the ends to fit tube junctions at proper angles—this requires careful filing or a dedicated tube miter jig. Braze or weld joints. Silver brazing works well for thin-wall tubing. If welding, use TIG to prevent burn-through.

The critical measurements:
- Seat tube: 18-22 inches (depending on rider height)
- Top tube: 20-24 inches
- Head angle: 72-74 degrees
- Seat angle: 73-75 degrees
- Chainstay length: 16-17 inches

*Wheel building*: This is an art. You need perfectly round rims, uniform spokes, and proper hubs. For a 36-spoke wheel (standard), you'll lace spokes in a three-cross pattern. Thread each spoke through the hub flange, cross it over three other spokes, and insert into the rim. Tension gradually, working around the wheel in quarters. True the wheel by adjusting spoke tension—tighten spokes toward the high side to pull the rim over. Final tension should be high enough that you can barely deflect spokes by squeezing pairs together.

**Wheel dishing**: For rear wheels with offset hub flanges (to accommodate gears/sprockets), the wheel must be "dished"—centered in the frame despite asymmetric hub geometry. Spokes on the drive side (gear side) will be tighter than non-drive side spokes. Check dishing by laying the wheel flat and measuring from rim to surface on both sides—should be equal. Improper dishing causes the bike to pull to one side or rub the frame.

Manufacture spokes from wire (14 gauge steel wire, 1.63mm diameter by AWG standard, sometimes called 2mm colloquially). Thread both ends—one end with a spoke nipple thread, the other with a head formed by upsetting the wire in a forge. This requires a spoke threading die and heading die.

Rims can be rolled from steel strip, welded into a circle, and drilled for spoke holes. Achieving perfect roundness is difficult. Wooden rims can work for low-speed applications but lack durability.

*Chains and gears*: Chain manufacture requires precision machining beyond most early workshops. Salvage and preserve chains carefully. Sprockets can be cut from steel plate on a mill, though you need careful tooth profile work.

*Practical timeline*: In Year 1-2, rely entirely on salvage and repair. In Year 3-5, begin manufacturing simple frames for replacement. Wheels remain largely salvage-dependent for 5-10 years. Only established workshops with precision tools can manufacture chains and bearings.

**Tire Manufacturing and Alternatives**

Tires are the critical constraint for bicycle and vehicle longevity. The chapter correctly identifies rubber tree cultivation or extensive chemical processing as the long-term solution, but intermediate options exist:

*Solid Rubber Tires (Low-Speed Applications)*:

Salvaged rubber (old tires, industrial rubber, vehicle components) can be carved or molded into solid tires. This works for:
- Agricultural equipment (speeds <10 mph)
- Heavy cargo bikes
- Wheelbarrows and hand carts

Process:
- Cut salvaged rubber to appropriate thickness (1-2 inches)
- Shape to fit rim (may need heating to form)
- Secure with adhesive or mechanical fasteners
- Performance: Heavy, harsh ride, but no flats and long-lasting

*Leather Tires (Historical Option)*:

Before pneumatic rubber tires, bicycles used leather. It's far from ideal but functional:
- Cut leather strips 2-3 inches wide, length matching wheel circumference
- Soak in water to soften
- Wrap tightly around rim, overlap edges
- Stitch or rivet in place
- Apply tallow or oil for weather resistance

Expect:
- Frequent replacement (weeks to months depending on use)
- Slippery when wet
- Poor cushioning
- Works for emergency transport, not long-term solution

*Metal Tires (Slow Speed Only)*:

For agricultural carts and wagons moving <5 mph:
- Solid iron band (traditional wheelwright approach)
- Mild steel strip wrapped and welded
- Provides durability, zero cushioning

NOT for bicycles (too heavy, dangerous)

*Tire Retreading*:

Extend salvaged tire life by retreading:
- Remove worn tread rubber (cut or grind away)
- Clean tire casing thoroughly
- Apply new rubber layer (salvaged rubber, melted and formed, or natural rubber if available)
- Vulcanize if possible (heat with sulfur - see chemistry chapter)

This requires skill and materials but can double or triple tire lifespan. Focus retreading efforts on critical vehicles (emergency transport, heavy haulers).

*Natural Rubber Production (Long-Term)*:

**Rubber trees** (Hevea brasiliensis) grow in tropical climates:
- Tap trees for latex (milky sap)
- Collect and coagulate latex
- Smoke over fires to preserve (creates sheet rubber)
- Vulcanize with sulfur to create stable rubber

Timeline: Plant trees Year 1-3, first tapping Year 6-8, mature production Year 10+.

**Alternative rubber sources**:
- Dandelions (Taraxacum kok-saghyz) - produces latex but lower yield
- Guayule shrubs (in arid regions)
- Some milkweeds

**Vulcanization Process** (turns soft latex into durable rubber):
- Mix rubber with sulfur (5-8% by weight)
- Heat to 250-300°F for hours
- Sulfur cross-links rubber molecules, making it elastic and durable
- Without vulcanization, natural rubber remains sticky and degrades quickly

This is Tier 2-3 technology requiring chemistry knowledge and controlled heating.

*Strategic Tire Management*:

Until rubber production is established:
1. **Ration tire use**: Reserve pneumatic-tired vehicles for critical missions
2. **Maintain pressure**: Under-inflation ruins tires fast - check weekly
3. **Avoid hazards**: Clear roads of debris, avoid sharp objects
4. **Rotate regularly**: Distribute wear evenly across tire stock
5. **Repair punctures immediately**: Small punctures become tears if ignored
6. **Store spare tires properly**: Cool, dark, inflated to prevent cracking

Accept that bicycle and vehicle use will decline as tires fail unless rubber production is established or alternatives prove adequate. Plan transportation networks around this constraint.

### Carts and Wheelbarrows

A wheelbarrow multiplies human carrying capacity fivefold. A person who can carry 50 pounds can push 250 pounds in a wheelbarrow. Two-wheeled carts extend this further.

**Wheelbarrow Construction**

The simplest wheelbarrow uses:
- A wheel (bicycle wheel, hand-cut wooden wheel, or salvaged wheel from lawn equipment)
- Two handles (ash, oak, or hickory wood, 5 feet long, 1.5 inches diameter)
- A bed (wooden box or metal bin)
- Braces connecting handles to bed

Cut handles from straight-grained hardwood. They must withstand flexing under load. Shape the gripping ends comfortably. The wheel mounts at the forward end where handles converge. Create an axle from 1/2-inch steel rod passing through both handles. The wheel spins on this axle. Mount the bed 12-18 inches behind the wheel, secured to both handles with bolts or strong joinery.

The bed can be a simple wooden box (12 inches deep, 18 inches wide, 24 inches long) made from 3/4-inch boards. Or form a metal bin from salvaged sheet metal. Angled sides help with dumping loads.

Critical ratios: The distance from handles to wheel should be approximately 1/3 the total handle length. This provides mechanical advantage—you lift only about 40% of the load weight while the wheel supports the rest.

**Two-Wheeled Carts**

A two-wheeled cart balances on its axle, with the human providing stability and motive force. This design can carry 200-400 pounds depending on construction.

Build a rectangular frame (4 feet long, 3 feet wide) from 2x4 lumber or welded steel tubing. Mount wheels on an axle beneath this frame. Extend two pulling shafts forward from the frame. These shafts rest on the ground when parked and lift to waist height when pulled.

Bicycle wheels work for light carts. For heavy loads, use larger wheels (20-26 inch diameter) salvaged from hand trucks, lawn equipment, or early manufacture. The axle must be sturdy—3/4 inch steel rod minimum, 1 inch preferred. It passes through both sides of the frame and through the wheel hubs.

Add a bed to the frame. Wooden slats work for most purposes. Incorporate stakes at corners to contain loads. If transporting liquids, seal the bed with pitch or line with salvaged plastic sheeting.

**Human-Powered Vehicles Beyond Bicycles**

Cargo tricycles with large front bins can carry 100-150 pounds. Bicycle trailers extend capacity further. Multi-person vehicles like bicycle rickshaws provide passenger transport. Each design trades efficiency for capacity.

For specialized needs, consider:
- Hand carts with four wheels for very heavy loads (500+ pounds)
- Stretcher-style carriers for the injured (requires two carriers)
- Pack frames for foot travel in rough terrain where wheels don't function

## Animal-Powered Transport

### Draft Animals

Animals transform transportation. A single horse can pull a ton. A team of oxen can move three tons. This isn't just quantitative improvement—it's qualitative. Distances that were impassable on foot become accessible. Trade routes extend from neighboring villages to regional networks.

**Horses**

Horses move faster than oxen (walking speed 4 mph vs 2 mph) but require more care and better feed. They're intelligent, trainable, but skittish. A horse can pull approximately 8 times its body weight on wheels, 1/10th that in a dragged load.

**Rolling resistance detail**: The 8:1 ratio assumes hard, smooth pavement (rolling resistance coefficient ~0.02). On soft ground (dirt, grass), the coefficient rises to 0.1 or higher, reducing pull capacity by 5x or more. This is why road quality matters enormously—the difference between a 1-ton load on pavement and a 200-pound load through mud with the same animal.

For draft purposes, seek heavy breeds if possible: draft horses, draft crosses, or sturdy quarter horses. These have the temperament and build for pulling. Avoid hot-blooded breeds (thoroughbreds, Arabians) for draft work—they lack the calm needed for steady pulling.

A working horse needs 15-25 pounds of feed daily—hay plus grain. This is significant. One horse requires 3-4 acres of dedicated cropland or pasture. Consider this when deciding herd size.

Training a horse to pull requires patience. Start with a trained animal if possible—they'll teach others by example. If training from scratch:
1. Accustom the horse to the harness (let them wear it while walking, no pulling yet)
2. Attach lightweight dragging items (small logs, empty sledges)
3. Gradually increase weight
4. Introduce the cart or wagon with help from an experienced animal
5. Practice starts, stops, turns, and backing up

**Oxen**

Oxen are castrated cattle trained for draft work. They're slower than horses but stronger relative to size, calmer, and less demanding of feed quality. Oxen can subsist on rougher forage. They also serve as emergency food in crisis—horses are less practical as food animals.

A team of oxen (two animals) can pull 2-3 tons on a wheeled vehicle. They work in yokes, with the weight distributed across their shoulders. Oxen respond to voice commands more than rein control.

Training oxen starts young (1-2 years old). Pair them early and keep pairs together—they learn to move as a unit. Basic commands: "Get up" (go), "Whoa" (stop), "Gee" (turn right), "Haw" (turn left), "Back" (reverse). Use consistent voice tones. Guide with a light touch using a stick, never through force.

**Mules and Donkeys**

Mules (horse-donkey hybrids) combine advantages: stronger than horses, less food than horses, more intelligent than either parent. They're sterile, so you need access to both horses and donkeys for breeding. Mules are excellent for rough terrain and have legendary endurance.

Donkeys themselves work well for light draft and pack work. A donkey can carry 100-150 pounds of pack load and walk all day. In arid regions, donkeys outperform horses.

### Harness Making

Animals need harnesses to transfer pulling force to vehicles without injury. Poor harness design cripples animals.

**Collar Harness (for horses/mules)**

A collar harness distributes force across the shoulders and chest. The collar is a padded oval that sits on the shoulders. Traces (strong straps) connect the collar to the vehicle.

Construction:
1. Shape a collar foundation from wood bent into an oval (20-24 inch tall, 18-20 inch wide at base). Steam-bend ash or oak.
2. Pad the inside with straw or foam wrapped in leather or canvas. Padding should be 2-3 inches thick where it contacts the animal.
3. Cover the outside with leather, stitched firmly.
4. Attach hames (metal or wood pieces) to the collar sides. These provide attachment points for traces.
5. Create traces from 2-inch wide leather straps or woven plant fiber reinforced with leather. They must withstand thousands of pounds of tension.
6. Add a back strap connecting collar to crupper (tail strap) to keep the harness positioned.

The collar must fit the specific animal. Too tight causes sores. Too loose shifts and rubs.

**Yoke (for oxen)**

Oxen use yokes rather than collars. A yoke is a wooden beam that rests on the necks of two oxen.

Cut a yoke from a solid timber 6-8 feet long (depending on ox size), 4-6 inches thick. Carve two shallow depressions where ox necks will sit. These curves should match the animal's neck shape. Drill holes below each depression for bows—these are U-shaped pieces that pass under the ox neck and pin into the yoke, securing the animal.

Bows can be formed from steamed hickory or ash bent into a U, or forged from iron. They need quick-release pins so oxen can be freed quickly if needed.

Attach a chain or beam to the center of the yoke for pulling. The yoke distributes force across both animals' shoulders evenly.

**Materials and Maintenance**

Leather is the traditional harness material. It's strong, flexible, and repairable. Treat leather with neat's-foot oil or animal fats to keep it supple. Inspect harnesses weekly for cracking or wear.

**→ See Chapter 0.5: Agriculture and Food Production** for leather tanning techniques, animal husbandry for draft animals, and feed production for working animals.

In leather scarcity, substitute:
- Woven plant fiber (hemp, flax) for non-critical straps
- Rawhide for high-strength components
- Canvas or heavy cloth for padding
- Chain for traces (less comfortable but durable)

### Pack Saddles (For Terrain Where Wheels Don't Work)

In rough terrain—mountains, dense forest, rocky ground—wheeled vehicles are impractical. Pack animals carrying loads directly become essential transport.

**Why Pack Saddles Matter**:

A horse or mule can carry 150-200 pounds of pack load all day. A donkey manages 100-150 pounds. This is far less than cart capacity but works where no cart can go. Pack trains (multiple animals in line) move significant cargo through terrain that would stop wagons.

**Basic Pack Saddle Construction**:

A pack saddle distributes load weight across the animal's back without causing injury.

*Components*:

1. **Saddle tree** (rigid frame):
   - Two side bars (wood) 24-30 inches long, following the curve of the animal's back
   - Front and rear cross-pieces (bows) connecting the side bars
   - Traditionally bent wood (steam-bent ash or hickory) or carved from solid timber
   - Must fit the specific animal - too narrow pinches spine, too wide presses on kidneys

2. **Padding** (critical for preventing sores):
   - Thick wool blankets, felt pads, or straw-filled cushions
   - Minimum 2 inches thickness between wood and animal
   - Must be kept clean and dry (sweat+dirt=sores)
   - Air circulation important - use pad with raised channels or periodically remove to dry animal's back

3. **Rigging** (load attachment):
   - Crossbucks (X-shaped wooden frames) attach to side bars
   - Loads hang from crossbucks in balanced pairs
   - OR flat platform on top of saddle (less stable, works for bulky light loads)

4. **Breast strap and crupper** (prevent shifting):
   - **Breast strap**: wraps around animal's chest, prevents saddle sliding backward
   - **Crupper**: strap under tail, prevents saddle sliding forward
   - Both essential for steep terrain

5. **Cinch/girth**: strap beneath animal holding saddle in place
   - Must be snug but not tight - check frequently (tightens as animal breathes out, loosens as load settles)

**Pack Saddle Construction (Improvised)**:

If you lack traditional saddle-making materials:

Simple version:
- Two straight poles (3 feet long, 2 inches diameter)
- Lash poles parallel, spaced to match animal width (8-10 inches apart)
- Add crosspieces at front and back
- Pad heavily with blankets, grass, moss, or cloth
- Secure with rope girth
- Attach loads to sides of poles

This won't match a proper saddle's performance but works for emergency transport.

**Load Attachment Principles**:

1. **Balance is critical**:
   - Equal weight on both sides of animal (within a few pounds)
   - Unbalanced load shifts saddle, causes sores, may fall off
   - Weigh cargo or use spring scale to verify balance

2. **Weight distribution**:
   - Heavier items near animal's shoulders (stronger area)
   - Lighter items toward rear
   - Nothing hanging below belly or bumping legs

3. **Secure attachment**:
   - Lash loads firmly to saddle
   - Test by pulling hard - if load shifts, re-secure
   - Use quick-release knots so panicked animal can be unloaded fast

4. **Load types**:
   - **Pannier bags**: Paired bags hanging on each side (traditional, efficient)
   - **Tied bundles**: Roped cargo in balanced pairs
   - **Crates/boxes**: Hard containers (protect fragile goods)

**Packing Technique**:

1. Prepare balanced loads before approaching animal
2. Groom animal, check for injuries or sores
3. Place saddle pad, ensure proper position (no wrinkles)
4. Place saddle tree
5. Attach one load, then immediately attach balanced load on opposite side
6. Cinch securely (should be able to slip two fingers under cinch but not more)
7. Add breast strap and crupper
8. Walk animal a short distance, re-check cinch (often loosens)
9. Inspect frequently during travel

**Common Mistakes That Cause Injury**:

- Saddle slipping back (rubs loin, causes kidney damage) - use breast strap
- Saddle slipping forward (rubs shoulders) - use crupper
- Unbalanced load (twists saddle, creates pressure points)
- Dirty pads (dirt+sweat+friction=open sores)
- Over-cinching (restricts breathing, causes girth sores)
- Under-cinching (saddle rotates under belly, animal may panic)

**Pack Animal Care**:

- Inspect back daily for sores, swelling, heat
- Remove saddle and pads during rest stops (let back air-dry)
- Never leave saddle on overnight
- Treat even small sores immediately (rest animal, clean wound)
- A sore-backed animal cannot work for weeks - prevention is essential

**Capacity Guidelines**:

- Horse: 150-200 lbs (20% of body weight maximum)
- Mule: 150-250 lbs (stronger for size than horses)
- Donkey: 100-150 lbs
- Llama (if available): 75-100 lbs
- Goat (for light loads in extreme terrain): 20-40 lbs

Exceed these weights and you damage the animal.

**Pack Trains**:

Multiple animals in line:
- Lead animal follows handler
- Remaining animals tied head-to-tail (prevents bunching or straying)
- Space animals 6-8 feet apart
- One handler per 4-6 animals (experienced) or 2-3 animals (beginner)
- Travel pace: 2-3 mph over rough terrain

This allows moving tons of cargo through roadless areas.

### Rope and Cordage (Essential Infrastructure)

Rope appears throughout transportation: harnesses, rigging, load securing, bridge cables. Manufacturing rope is fundamental.

**Plant Fiber Sources**:

*Hemp* (Cannabis sativa):
- Best all-around rope fiber
- Strong, durable, resistant to rot and salt water
- Grows in temperate climates
- Harvest when plants flower, strip fibers from stalks, ret (soak to separate fibers), dry, comb
- Yields: 400-600 lbs of fiber per acre

*Flax* (Linum usitatissimum):
- Finer than hemp, good for smaller cordage
- Grows readily in cool climates
- Process similar to hemp
- Yields: 300-400 lbs fiber per acre

*Sisal* (Agave sisalana):
- Very strong, coarse fiber
- Tropical/subtropical plant
- Extract fibers from leaves
- Good for heavy-duty applications

*Other sources*:
- Nettle (Urtica dioica) - strong fine fiber, labor-intensive to process
- Yucca - desert regions
- Coconut fiber (coir) - coarse, rot-resistant, coastal tropics
- Inner bark of trees (basswood, cedar, willow) - emergency cordage

**Rope Construction**:

*Twisted Rope* (traditional three-strand):

Process:
1. **Prepare fibers**: Clean, comb, align fibers
2. **Spin into yarn**: Twist fibers together (clockwise - "Z-twist")
   - Hand-spin or use simple spinning wheel
   - Thickness depends on application
3. **Ply yarns into strands**: Twist multiple yarns together (counterclockwise - "S-twist")
   - Usually 3-4 yarns per strand
4. **Lay strands into rope**: Twist strands together (clockwise again)
   - Standard rope = 3 strands
   - Can be done by hand or with rope-walk machine

The alternating twist directions (Z-twist fibers, S-twist strands, Z-twist rope) creates tension that holds rope together.

**Rope-Walk**:

Traditional rope-making uses a rope-walk: long building or outdoor space where strands are stretched and twisted simultaneously.

Simple version:
- Two posts 50-100 feet apart
- Cranks at one end to twist strands
- Worker walks backward while feeding and guiding strands
- All three strands twist together into rope

*Braided Rope*:

More complex but stronger and more flexible than twisted:
- Interweave strands over-and-under
- Requires 4-16 strands depending on braid pattern
- Smoother than twisted rope, less prone to kinking
- Harder to make without tools

**Breaking Strength by Diameter** (Hemp rope, rough estimates):

- 1/4 inch diameter: 400 lbs breaking strength
- 1/2 inch: 1,400 lbs
- 3/4 inch: 3,000 lbs
- 1 inch: 5,000 lbs
- 1.5 inch: 11,000 lbs
- 2 inch: 20,000 lbs

Working load should be 1/4 to 1/5 of breaking strength for safety margin.

**Splicing** (Joining ropes without knots):

*Eye Splice* (creates permanent loop):
1. Unlay (untwist) rope end for 12-18 inches
2. Form loop to desired size
3. Tuck each strand back into the standing rope
4. Repeat tucks 3-5 times
5. Trim excess

*Short Splice* (joins two rope ends):
1. Unlay ends of both ropes
2. Interlock the strands
3. Tuck each strand into opposite rope
4. Creates strong join but thicker section

*Long Splice* (joins without thickness increase):
- More complex, used when rope must pass through pulleys
- Unlay longer sections, interweave and tuck carefully

**Rope Maintenance**:

- Keep clean (dirt cuts fibers)
- Dry thoroughly if wet (prevents rot)
- Inspect for wear, broken strands, rot
- Retire rope before failure (lives depend on it)
- Store coiled in dry location
- Tar treatment extends life (especially marine use)

**Improvised Cordage**:

Emergency cordage from:
- Braided grass or rushes (weak, temporary)
- Animal sinew (strong, small diameter)
- Rawhide strips (strong when dry, stretches when wet)
- Inner bark strips twisted together
- Salvaged wire (for non-flexible applications)

### Carts and Wagons

**Basic Cart Design**

A two-wheeled cart for a single animal (horse or pair of oxen):
- Shafts extending forward for animal harness attachment
- Axle supporting wheels (4-5 feet diameter preferred)
- Bed for cargo (4 feet x 6 feet typical)
- Weight capacity: 500-1000 pounds

Build the undercarriage first. Create an axle from hardwood (oak, ash, hickory) or steel if available. Wood axles should be 3-4 inches diameter. Steel can be 1.5-2 inches. The axle mounts beneath the cart bed on axle beds—curved wooden or metal supports that hold it in place while allowing some flex.

Wheels present the main challenge. See the Wheels and Axles section for detailed construction. Mount wheels so they spin freely on the axle. Use iron sleeves or bushings at the hub. Lubricate with grease or tallow.

The bed frame uses 2x6 or larger timbers. Cross-bracing prevents racking. Floor the bed with planks. Add removable side and end boards to contain loads.

Shafts extend forward 8-10 feet. They must be strong—2x4 minimum, 3x4 better. The animal walks between these shafts. Connect shafts to harness traces.

**Four-Wheeled Wagons**

Wagons offer greater capacity (2-3 tons) and stability but require more skilled construction. The critical feature is the front axle must pivot for turning.

Build front and rear axles separately, each with wheels. Mount the rear axle rigidly to the wagon bed. Mount the front axle on a pivot pin (kingpin) that allows it to rotate 30-40 degrees to each side. This is mechanically complex—the kingpin must be very strong and well-supported.

A wagon bed typically measures 4 feet wide by 10-12 feet long. Use heavy timber framing (4x6 or larger). The box should be removable to allow specialized beds (flat for lumber, high-sided for grain, tanked for liquids).

**Brake Systems for Wagons (Life-Critical on Steep Terrain)**

Brakes are essential for wagons. On flat ground, they prevent runaways when stopped. On steep descents, they're the difference between controlled travel and catastrophic crashes.

*Basic Brake Design (Lever-Operated Block)*:

The simplest brake: a wooden or metal block that presses against a wheel rim.

Components:
- **Brake shoe**: Hardwood block (oak, hickory) 12-18 inches long, 2-3 inches thick, shaped to match wheel rim curve
- **Brake shoe sizing critical**: Must contact at least 1/4 of the wheel rim circumference for adequate friction
  - For a 4-foot diameter wheel: brake shoe should be 36+ inches long (covering 90+ degrees of arc)
  - Too small = insufficient braking, wheel overruns brake
- **Brake lever**: Long handle (3-4 feet) providing mechanical advantage
- **Linkage**: Connects lever to brake shoe via rod or chain
- **Pivot point**: Allows brake shoe to press against rim when lever pulled

Operation:
- Driver pulls lever
- Linkage forces brake shoe against wheel rim
- Friction slows wheel rotation

Maintenance:
- Replace brake shoes when worn thin (check weekly for heavy use)
- Lubricate pivot points (NOT the brake shoe contact area!)
- Inspect linkage for wear or breakage before every loaded trip

*Parking Brake*:

A stopped wagon on even a slight slope will roll if not secured.

Simple parking brake:
- Ratchet mechanism on brake lever (notches that lock lever in applied position)
- OR block/wedge placed behind wheels
- OR chain wrapped around wheel and secured

*Drag Shoe (For Steep Descents)*:

When regular brakes are insufficient (long steep grades), use a drag shoe:
- Heavy piece of wood or metal (2x6 timber or steel angle)
- Chains from wagon frame to drag shoe
- Drop drag shoe beneath rear wheel so it drags on ground
- Creates continuous friction against ground AND prevents wheel rotation

Application:
- Before descent begins, stop wagon
- Position drag shoe beneath wheel
- Secure chains so drag shoe cannot shift out
- Descend slowly - drag shoe prevents wheel from turning freely
- Animal controls speed via harness resistance, drag shoe prevents runaway

**"Rough-Locking" (Chain Brake for Emergency)**:

If brakes fail on steep terrain, rough-lock the wheel:
- Wrap heavy chain around wheel rim
- Secure chain so wheel cannot rotate
- Wheel slides instead of rolling
- Harsh on equipment but prevents catastrophic runaway

Technique:
- Always carry heavy chain (20-30 feet) on mountain wagons
- Stop before slope becomes uncontrollable
- Wrap rear wheel completely, secure with multiple wraps
- Descend at walking pace
- Expect damage to wheel rim and chain - accept this as cost of survival

**Brake Rod Linkage (Four-Wheeled Wagons)**:

Large wagons need brakes on multiple wheels.

System:
- Brake shoes on both rear wheels
- Connecting rod between brake shoes (ensures both apply simultaneously)
- Single brake lever operates entire system via linkage
- Design so driver can apply maximum force without standing (leverage is critical)

**Testing Brakes**:

Before every loaded trip on hilly terrain:
1. Test brakes on level ground with load
2. Apply brakes, attempt to move wagon (animal pulling)
3. Wagon should not move with brakes fully applied
4. If wagon moves, brakes are inadequate - repair before continuing

**Brake Failure Consequences**:

Loaded wagon runaway kills:
- Animals (crushed when wagon overruns them)
- Driver (thrown from wagon or crushed)
- Wagon (destroyed on impact)
- Cargo (lost)
- Anyone downhill of the runaway

Prevention through proper brake design and maintenance is non-negotiable for mountain transport.

### Care and Feeding of Draft Animals

A lame or sick animal stops being transportation and becomes a liability. Prevention through good care is essential.

**Daily Care**

Inspect hooves daily. Horses need hoof trimming every 6-8 weeks, shoes every 8-10 weeks if working on hard surfaces. Oxen have cloven hooves requiring similar attention. Learn to trim hooves yourself or establish a farrier in your community.

Clean harness contact points on the animal's body. Sweat and dirt under harnesses cause sores that can disable an animal for weeks. Brush animals after work to remove sweat and prevent skin problems.

Provide water freely. A working horse drinks 10-12 gallons daily, more in hot weather. Oxen need similar amounts. Dehydration kills quickly.

**Feeding**

Draft animals need:
- Roughage (hay, straw, pasture grass): 2-3% of body weight daily
- Grain (oats, barley, corn): for working animals, 0.5-1% of body weight daily
- Salt: free-choice access to salt licks
- Minerals: varied diet usually provides these, or supplement with bone meal

A 1200-pound horse eats 24-36 pounds of roughage plus 6-12 pounds of grain daily when working. When idle, reduce grain. Overfeeding idle animals causes health problems.

Spread feeding throughout the day rather than one large meal. Animals have small stomachs relative to body size.

**Health Issues**

Colic (digestive upset) is common and dangerous. Symptoms include refusing food, pawing, looking at flanks, lying down repeatedly. Prevent through gradual diet changes, regular feeding schedule, and good feed quality. Treatment requires walking the animal and sometimes medication—establish contact with anyone who has veterinary knowledge.

Lameness has many causes: stone bruises, infections, improper shoeing, joint problems. Rest lame animals immediately. Continuing to work a lame animal often turns a minor issue into permanent disability.

External parasites (lice, mites, flies) irritate animals and spread disease. Control through cleanliness, manure management, and herbal repellents (wormwood, tansy, eucalyptus oils if available).

## Water Transport

Water is the ancient highway. Rivers and coastlines permit movement of massive loads with minimal effort. A single person poling a raft can move what would require a wagon train on land.

### Boats and Rafts

**Raft Construction**

The simplest watercraft is a raft of logs. Gather straight logs (8-16 inches diameter, 10-15 feet long). Cedar, pine, and other softwoods float better than hardwoods. Lay logs parallel. Lash them together with rope or secure with wooden cross-pieces.

A basic raft:
- 6-8 logs (12 feet long)
- Cross-pieces (top and bottom) bolted or pegged through logs
- Decking (planks laid across top) optional but useful

This raft floats 4-6 people plus cargo. Control with poles in shallow water (push against the bottom) or oars/paddles in deep water. Rafts don't track well—they rotate and drift. Use them for downstream travel or crossing, not for precise navigation.

Improve raft design:
- Taper the front to reduce water resistance
- Add raised sides to keep water out
- Include a shelter platform for weather protection
- Attach a rudder for directional control

**Dugout Canoes**

A dugout canoe carved from a single log combines light weight, durability, and good handling. Select a large, straight tree (cedar, pine, cottonwood—soft woods carve easier). 15-20 feet length, 2-3 feet diameter minimum.

Construction process:
1. Fell the tree and remove branches
2. Shape the exterior to a canoe profile (pointed ends, rounded bottom)
3. Hollow the interior using fire and adze work
   - Build small fires along the top to char wood
   - Scrape out charred wood with an adze
   - Repeat until walls are 1-2 inches thick
4. Smooth the interior with scrapers and sand
5. Seal any cracks with pitch

This requires weeks of work but produces a boat that lasts decades. A 15-foot dugout carries 2-3 people plus 300-400 pounds of cargo.

**Plank Boats**

Plank construction allows larger, more sophisticated boats but requires more skill and materials.

The simplest plank boat is a flat-bottomed skiff. Build it like a wooden box:
- Bottom: planks (1 inch thick, 12 inches wide) laid side-by-side, 10-14 feet long
- Sides: planks (3/4 inch thick, 12-18 inches tall) attached to bottom edges
- Ends: triangular pieces closing the box
- Frames: ribs inside providing shape and strength
- Seats: cross-members for rowers

Join planks edge-to-edge. Traditional methods:
- Overlap planks (clinker/lapstrake): upper plank overlaps lower, secured with copper nails clenched over roves (washers)
- Edge-to-edge (carvel): planks meet at edges, caulk seams with oakum (tarred hemp fibers) and seal with pitch

Waterproofing is critical. Caulk all seams thoroughly. Apply pitch or tar to the entire exterior. Inspect regularly and re-caulk as needed.

**Sails**

Wind power multiplies water transport effectiveness. A simple square sail catches wind from behind. More sophisticated rigs allow sailing at angles to the wind.

Make sails from:
- Canvas (if salvageable)
- Woven plant fiber (hemp, flax)
- Leather (for small sails)

A square sail for a small boat:
- Fabric: 8 feet tall, 10 feet wide
- Top spar: wooden pole holding the top edge
- Bottom spar or loose foot: holds shape at bottom
- Mast: vertical pole stepping into boat bottom
- Rigging: ropes to raise, lower, and control the sail

Sailing requires skill. Practice in safe conditions. Understand basic principles:
- Wind pushes the sail, boat moves perpendicular to the wind direction (with proper sail angle)
- Keel or centerboard prevents sideways drift
- Rudder controls direction
- Reefing (reducing sail area) necessary in strong wind

### Navigation

**Maps**

Create regional maps immediately. Accurate maps are strategic assets. Document:
- Waterways (rivers, streams, lakes)
- Coastlines
- Landmarks (mountains, distinctive trees, ruins)
- Settlements
- Resources (clay deposits, iron outcroppings, good timber stands)
- Distances (measured in travel time)

Survey methods without modern tools:
- Pace counting: measure your stride, count paces, calculate distance
- Dead reckoning: track direction and distance traveled from a known point
- Triangulation: locate positions by angles from known landmarks
- Celestial observation: latitude from sun angle at noon

Draw maps on paper, cloth, or leather. Include scale information. Copy maps—losing the only regional map is catastrophic.

**Compass**

A magnetic compass provides consistent directional reference. Manufacture a simple compass:

1. Magnetize a needle by stroking it repeatedly with a magnet (salvage magnets from speakers, motors)
2. Float the needle on water (stick it through cork or lay on leaf)
3. The needle aligns north-south

Permanent compass: Mount the magnetized needle on a pivot in a sealed container. Mark cardinal directions on the container. Protect from hard impacts that can demagnetize the needle.

Compass variation: Magnetic north differs from true north by varying amounts depending on location. Determine local variation by comparing compass reading to known north (Polaris at night, sun at noon).

**Celestial Navigation**

The sun and stars provide navigational information without any tools.

*Finding north*:
- Night: Locate Polaris (North Star) by following the pointer stars of the Big Dipper
- Day: Plant a vertical stick, mark shadow tip position at two times 30+ minutes apart, draw line between marks—this runs east-west

*Determining latitude*:
Measure the angle of Polaris above the horizon. This angle equals your latitude. Without tools, estimate by hand-widths (each hand-width at arm's length is approximately 10 degrees). At 45 degrees north latitude, Polaris appears about 4.5 hand-widths above the horizon.

*Time and longitude*:
Without accurate clocks, longitude determination is impractical. Rely on dead reckoning and landmark navigation.

### River and Coastal Travel

**River Navigation**

Rivers flow one direction. Use this. Float downstream with the current (potentially with minimal effort). Travel upstream requires poling, rowing, sailing, or towing.

Techniques for upstream travel:
- Poling: Push against river bottom with long poles (works in shallow water)
- Rowing: Powerful but exhausting over long distances
- Sail: If wind direction cooperates
- Towing: Walk along shore pulling the boat with ropes (slow but effective)

River hazards:
- Rapids: Fast water over rocks. Scout before running. Often better to portage (carry boat around)
- Snags: Submerged logs can hole a boat
- Low bridges: May require unstepping mast or portaging
- Waterfalls: Portage mandatory

**Coastal Travel**

Coastlines offer long-distance travel routes but present different hazards than rivers.

Tidal awareness is essential. Learn local tide patterns. High tide floods areas that are dry at low tide. Strong tidal currents in narrow passages can overwhelm small boats.

Weather watching: Sea conditions change faster than rivers. Morning calm can become afternoon storm. Learn to read clouds and wind patterns. Avoid open water in threatening weather.

Stay close to shore in small boats. You want the option to beach quickly if conditions deteriorate. Travel during calm periods (often early morning).

## Roads and Bridges

### Road Maintenance

Existing paved roads will degrade but remain useful for years. Prioritize maintaining critical routes between communities.

**Pothole Repair**

Water infiltrates cracks, freezes, expands, and breaks pavement. Small cracks become potholes. Repair process:
1. Clear debris from the hole
2. Cut the hole to vertical edges (remove loose material)
3. Fill with compacted gravel or crushed stone
4. Top with salvaged asphalt (melt and pour) or tar-mixed gravel
5. Compact firmly

Without modern materials, pack holes with stone and gravel. It requires frequent re-packing but maintains passability.

**Drainage (Road's Greatest Enemy)**

Water is the enemy of roads. It infiltrates, freezes, expands, and destroys pavement. It erodes dirt roads into impassable gullies. Proper drainage is the difference between roads that last decades and roads that fail in months.

*Drainage Ditches*:

Parallel ditches on both sides of road collect and channel water away.

Design:
- Ditch should be 12-18 inches deep, 24-36 inches wide
- Slope bottom gently downhill (2-4% grade) so water flows away
- Locate 3-6 feet from road edge (far enough to not undermine road base)
- Line ditches with stone if erosion is problem

Maintenance:
- Clear vegetation (roots block flow, plants hold water)
- Remove debris after storms
- Re-dig settled sections
- Ensure outlets drain to natural waterways (streams, low ground)

*Crown* (Road Cross-Section):

Road surface must be higher in center than edges.

- **Crown height**: Center should be 4-6 inches higher than edges (for 20-foot wide road)
- This creates ~2-3% slope from center to each edge
- Water runs off to ditches instead of ponding
- Critical for dirt roads (water on surface = mud)

Re-establish crown by:
- Grading road surface with blade or scraper
- Pulling material from edges to center
- Compacting center
- Repeat annually or after heavy traffic

*Culverts* (Water Passage Under Road):

Streams and drainage paths crossing road need culverts - pipes or structures allowing water to pass beneath road.

Simple culvert construction:
- Dig trench across road at natural water flow path
- Install pipe (salvaged metal pipe, concrete pipe, or wooden box culvert)
- Pipe diameter: 12-24 inches for small drainage, 36+ inches for streams
- Slope pipe 1-2% downhill in direction of water flow
- Bury pipe with compacted fill
- Armor inlet and outlet with stone (prevents erosion)

Wooden box culvert (if no pipe available):
- Build rectangular box from heavy timber (12"x12" to 24"x24" interior)
- Make from rot-resistant wood (oak, cedar, locust)
- Assemble with strong joints and fasteners
- Line bottom with flat stones
- Expect 5-10 year lifespan (inspect and rebuild as needed)

Maintenance:
- Inspect after every major storm
- Clear debris blocking inlet
- Repair washouts at outlet
- Replace failed culverts immediately (road will be cut otherwise)

*French Drains* (Subsurface Drainage):

For roads on wet ground or where water seeps up from below:

Construction:
- Dig trench alongside road, 2-3 feet deep
- Fill bottom 6-12 inches with large stones
- Add layer of smaller gravel (fills voids)
- Optionally cover with fabric or bark to prevent soil infiltration
- Backfill remaining trench with soil

Water seeps into stone-filled trench, flows away underground.

More effective than surface ditch in some situations (especially where surface water isn't the problem).

*Road Surfacing Materials*:

Different materials for different conditions:

*Gravel*:
- Use angular crushed stone (interlocks better than round river gravel)
- Size: 3/4 to 1.5 inch diameter base layer, 1/4 to 3/4 inch top layer
- Depth: 6-12 inches compacted
- Apply in layers, compact each
- Add fresh gravel annually to compensate for material pressed into soil

*Road Metal* (Broken Stone):
- Crushed stone or broken rock
- Larger than gravel (2-4 inch pieces)
- Used as base layer under gravel
- Provides strong foundation, excellent drainage
- Source: Quarry crushed rock or break fieldstones with sledgehammer

*Corduroy Roads* (Logs):
- For swampy/muddy sections where conventional surface fails
- Lay logs perpendicular to road direction
- Place logs tightly side-by-side (no gaps)
- Secure with stakes or cross-pieces
- Cover with earth or gravel if desired
- Rough ride but passable in mud
- Expect 5-10 year life in wet conditions

*Cut and Fill* (Hillside Road Construction):

On slopes, road requires leveling:

- **Cut**: Dig into hillside (uphill side of road)
- **Fill**: Use cut material to build up downhill side
- Creates level roadbed on slope

Critical:
- Compact fill thoroughly (loose fill settles and fails)
- Provide drainage for cut face (water runs down hill, must be channeled)
- Angle cut face slope stable (45-60 degrees typical, depends on soil)
- Retaining walls may be needed on steep fill (stone, timber, or gabions)

Inadequate compaction of fill = road collapse. Take time to do it right.

**Surface Renewal**

Unpaved roads need regular grading and gravel addition. Once or twice yearly, drag a road with a heavy log or blade to smooth ruts and redistribute material. Add gravel to worn areas.

For heavily-used routes, consider corduroy roads: logs laid perpendicular to traffic direction. This works in muddy conditions where conventional surfaces fail. Lay logs tightly side-by-side, secured with stakes or cross-pieces.

### Bridge Construction

**Log Bridges**

For streams up to 20 feet wide, lay logs across.

Simple method:
- Fell trees 25-30 feet long, 12+ inches diameter
- Lay 3-4 logs parallel across the gap
- Secure with stakes driven into ground at each end
- Add cross-planking for walking/cart surface

Improve by notching logs into sill beams on each bank. This prevents shifting.

**Trestle Bridges**

For wider spans or higher crossings, build a trestle: an elevated framework.

Components:
- Sills: beams resting on ground/rock foundations at each end
- Bents: vertical frames supporting the bridge deck (like sawhorses)
- Stringers: longitudinal beams running the bridge length, resting on bents
- Decking: cross-planks providing the surface

A bent consists of vertical posts (4x6 or larger) with cross-bracing. Space bents 10-15 feet apart. Make them progressively taller to match terrain height as needed.

Critical: Foundation stability. On solid ground, bury posts 3-4 feet deep. In soft ground or water, drive sharpened posts deeper or add footings (flat stones, timbers).

**Suspension Bridges**

For very wide spans, suspension bridges offer solutions. These require significant engineering skill.

Basic principle: Cables or ropes strung across the gap support a walking deck via vertical hangers. The cables anchor firmly on both sides, ideally to bedrock or massive timber frameworks buried and weighted with stones.

Manufacture cable from:
- Salvaged steel cable (ideal)
- Woven plant fiber rope (hemp, flax) twisted into heavy cables
- Chain (if metalworking capability exists)

Build conservatively. Suspension bridges can fail catastrophically if poorly designed. Start with small foot bridges before attempting vehicle-capable spans.

## Wheels and Axles

The wheel seems simple but is mechanically complex to manufacture well. A poor wheel fails quickly under load.

**→ See Chapter 2: Metalworking** for forging iron axles, casting metal hubs, and manufacturing metal wheel components.
**→ See Chapter 2.7: Standardization and Interchangeable Parts** for critical importance of standardizing axle dimensions, hub sizes, and wheel specifications across your community's vehicles.

### Wheel Design

A wheel needs:
- Hub: central cylinder containing the axle bearing
- Spokes: transfer load from hub to rim
- Rim: circular outer section that contacts ground or tire
- Tire: outer surface (optional but beneficial)

**Solid Wooden Wheels**

Cut a disc from a thick plank or glue-up of planks. This works for small, light-duty applications (wheelbarrows, handcarts). Solid wheels are heavy and crack along the grain. Improve by cutting from cross-grain sections (like cutting a log into wheels), but wood movement still causes problems.

**Spoked Wheels**

Spokes reduce weight while maintaining strength. This is traditional wagon wheel design.

Construction:
1. *Hub*: Turn a cylinder (8-10 inches diameter, 6-8 inches long) from hardwood on a lathe. Bore a central hole for the axle (tight fit). Drill holes around the perimeter for spoke mortises.

2. *Spokes*: Cut 12-16 spokes from straight-grained hardwood (oak, ash, hickory). They should be 1.5-2 inches diameter at the hub end, tapering to 1-1.5 inches at rim end. Length depends on wheel diameter (12-16 inches for typical spokes in a 4-foot wheel).

3. *Felloes* (rim sections): Cut 6-8 curved sections that assemble into a circle. Steam-bend or cut from curved wood. Each felloe has mortises for spoke ends.

4. *Assembly*:
   - Insert spokes into hub mortises (glued and wedged)
   - Insert spoke outer ends into felloe mortises
   - Assemble felloes into complete rim
   - Drive wheelwright's dowels through felloe joints
   - Shrink iron tire onto rim (see below)

**Iron Tires**

An iron band around the rim protects wood and holds felloes together. Forge a band slightly smaller diameter than the wooden rim. Heat to red heat. While hot, mount on the rim and rapidly cool with water. The iron shrinks, gripping the wood tightly. This requires quick work and assistance—the hot iron is dangerous and the window for mounting is brief.

Without smithing capability, wrap the rim with multiple layers of salvaged metal strapping or heavy wire. Less effective but better than bare wood.

### Axles and Bearings

The axle passes through the wheel hub. The interface must allow rotation with minimal friction while supporting heavy loads.

**Fixed Axle Design**

The axle doesn't rotate; the wheels spin around it. This is simpler. The axle is a stationary beam. Wheels mount on the axle ends via hub bearings.

Bearing options:
- Wood-on-wood: Hub bore slightly larger than axle, lubricated with grease/tallow. Works but wears quickly.
- Metal sleeve bearing: Press iron or brass sleeves into hub bore. Less friction, longer life.
- Ball bearings: Salvaged ball bearings are gold. Install carefully and protect from dirt.

**Rotating Axle Design**

The axle and wheels rotate together. The axle spins in bearings mounted to the vehicle frame. This is mechanically simpler at the wheel (axle fixed to hub) but requires good bearings where axle meets frame.

Lubrication is essential. Wooden bearings need daily greasing. Metal bearings need less frequent but regular lubrication. Without grease, bearings overheat and seize.

Make grease from animal fats. Tallow (rendered animal fat) works adequately. Mix with vegetable oils for better performance at varying temperatures. In emergencies, use straight oil or even mud—something is better than nothing.

**→ See Chapter 2.8: Lubricants and Seals** for detailed lubricant formulation, grease manufacturing, and bearing protection methods. Proper lubrication determines whether your vehicles last months or decades.

## Maintaining Salvaged Vehicles

Gasoline vehicles, electric vehicles, and other modern transport will function if maintained. Fuel is the limiting factor.

### Internal Combustion Engines

**If Fuel is Available**

Gasoline degrades over months. Diesel lasts longer (years if stored properly). Stabilized fuel lasts longest but eventually becomes unusable. Once salvage fuel is exhausted, vehicle operation depends on production.

Producing gasoline requires:
- Petroleum feedstock (crude oil or alternatives)
- Distillation equipment
- Understanding of fractional distillation
This is Tier 2-3 technology, possible but complex.

**→ See Chapter 4: Chemistry** for petroleum distillation, ethanol production via fermentation, chemical fuel synthesis, and lubricant manufacturing.

Ethanol (alcohol) can substitute for or extend gasoline. Produce ethanol via fermentation:
1. Ferment sugary or starchy material (grains, fruit, potatoes)
2. Distill to 95% alcohol content
3. Use pure or blend with gasoline (10-85% ethanol)

Most gasoline engines run on ethanol with minimal modification. Carburetors may need rejetting. Fuel lines must be ethanol-resistant (modern vehicles post-2000 usually are).

**E85 (85% ethanol) requires specific modifications**:
- Fuel flow increased ~30% (ethanol contains less energy per volume than gasoline)
- Carburetor jets enlarged or replaced
- For fuel-injected engines: ECU reprogramming or replacement (complex)
- Cold starting problems (ethanol vaporizes poorly below 50°F—may need gasoline primer or heated fuel)
- Corrosion issues with older fuel systems (rubber hoses, gaskets degrade; use ethanol-compatible materials)
- Lower energy density: expect 20-30% reduction in fuel economy vs gasoline
- Advantage: Can be produced locally from crops without petroleum refining

**Maintenance Priorities**

Oil changes: Engine oil degrades with use. Change every 3000-5000 miles, more frequently with poor oil quality. Manufacture oil from petroleum if available, or accept reduced engine life and frequent rebuild.

Filters: Air filters prevent engine wear. Clean and reuse foam filters. Replace paper filters or manufacture substitutes from cloth.

Cooling: Maintain coolant levels. Pure water works but causes corrosion and freezes. Antifreeze (ethylene glycol) is chemically complex to produce.

Tires: The ultimate consumable. Salvaged tires last years but eventually fail. Manufacture requires rubber (plantations or extensive chemistry) and sophisticated equipment. In tire scarcity, reduce vehicle use, drive slowly, maintain proper inflation, and develop alternatives (solid rubber or metal wheels for slow speeds).

**Strategic Value**

A single working truck can transform a community's capabilities. Haul tons of cargo. Transport the injured. Move building materials. Use it wisely—wear parts are irreplaceable long-term.

### Electric Vehicles

EVs have fewer moving parts than combustion engines. If you have electrical generation (solar, wind, hydro), EVs can operate indefinitely with less maintenance.

**Advantages**

- No fuel production needed beyond electricity
- Fewer fluids (no oil changes)
- Regenerative braking reduces wear
- Simpler drivetrains

**Maintenance**

Battery health is critical. Lithium batteries degrade over time and cycles. Maintain charge between 20-80% when possible. Extreme temperatures accelerate degradation. Without replacement battery production (complex chemistry and manufacturing), each EV has finite life.

Tires and suspension wear the same as combustion vehicles.

Electrical system repairs require specialized knowledge. Establish at least one person in your community who understands high-voltage systems and EV architecture.

**Charging Infrastructure**

Solar panels can charge EVs directly via charge controllers. A modest solar array (4-6 kilowatts) can add significant daily range to an EV. Wind turbines work similarly.

Without grid power, charging is slower. Plan trips around charge times. An EV becomes a local vehicle, not long-distance transport, unless you establish charging networks.

## Steam Engines for Transport

Steam technology enables mechanized transport without petroleum. It requires metalworking and precision, but these are achievable with early industrial capabilities.

### Steam Engine Basics

Steam engines convert heat into motion:
1. Boil water to create steam (pressure)
2. Direct steam into cylinder with piston
3. Steam pressure pushes piston
4. Piston drives crankshaft (rotary motion)
5. Exhaust steam and repeat

Critical components:
- Boiler: Generates steam safely under pressure
- Cylinder and piston: Converts pressure to linear motion
- Valving: Controls steam flow timing
- Crankshaft: Converts linear to rotary motion

### Railroad Potential

Rails provide low-friction transport. A horse pulling a wagon moves 1-2 tons. That same horse pulling a rail car moves 5-10 tons. Replace the horse with a steam locomotive and move hundreds of tons.

**Rail Infrastructure**

Existing rail lines can be rehabilitated. Rails themselves last decades. Ties (sleepers) rot and need replacement. Wooden ties last 7-15 years depending on wood species and treatment. Manufacture replacement ties from durable woods (oak, cedar, locust) or salvage.

Switches and signals may be too complex to maintain without industrial support. Simplified systems work: manual switches, flag signals, scheduled runs preventing collisions.

**Locomotives**

Simple locomotives can be built with basic industrial capabilities:
- Boiler: Riveted steel tank rated for pressure (100-150 psi)
- Engine: Two or four cylinders driving wheels directly
- Cab and controls: Basic shelter and valves

**⚠️ BOILER SAFETY WARNING**: Boiler explosions were historically common and catastrophic, killing entire crews and bystanders. A boiler failure releases superheated steam and water explosively, with energy equivalent to tons of TNT. Conservative design is critical:
- Safety valves (multiple, independently mounted)
- Pressure gauges (verify regularly against known standards)
- Water level indicators (low water = catastrophic overheating)
- Regular inspections for corrosion, cracks, and rivet failures
- Hydrostatic pressure testing (test to 1.5x operating pressure before use)
- Operator training (never override safety devices, maintain water level religiously)
- Never exceed design pressure. A 150 psi boiler operating at 160 psi is a bomb.

This is advanced Tier 2 technology. You need:
- Iron/steel working
- Precision machining
- Boiler-making knowledge (failures kill)
- Understanding of thermodynamics

**Hand Cars and Velocipedes**

Before steam, human-powered rail vehicles provide immediate benefit. A hand car is a platform on rail wheels with a pump handle. Two people pumping can move at 10-15 mph carrying cargo. Build from salvaged rail wheels and simple framing.

### Stationary Steam Engines

Before mobile steam, use stationary engines for:
- Sawmills (cutting lumber faster)
- Grain mills (grinding via belt drive)
- Pumps (water for irrigation or mining)
- Workshop power (lathes, drills via line shafts)

A stationary engine is simpler than locomotive—no need to move the heavy boiler. This is a reasonable Tier 2 goal.

## Navigation and Mapping

Good navigation requires tools, knowledge, and practice.

**→ See Chapter 3.2: Navigation and Mapping** (if available) for comprehensive coverage of surveying, cartography, celestial navigation, and mapmaking techniques. This section provides transportation-specific navigation essentials.

### Surveying Without Modern Tools

**Distance Measurement**

- Pacing: Calibrate your stride (measure 100 feet precisely, count steps, calculate steps per mile). Experienced pacers achieve 2-3% accuracy.
- Chain or rope: Measure distance with known-length chain or rope (100 feet traditional). Lay repeatedly, mark positions.
- Odometer: Wheel of known circumference, count rotations. Build from salvaged bicycle wheel and a counting mechanism.

**Angle Measurement**

- Protractor: Salvage or manufacture from sheet material with degree markings
- Cross-staff: Two perpendicular sticks allow angle sighting
- Astrolabe: Measures angle of celestial objects above horizon

**Creating Maps**

Process for mapping unknown territory:
1. Choose origin point (established settlement)
2. Travel routes systematically, measuring distances and directions
3. Note landmarks, water features, terrain changes
4. Plot on paper using scale (e.g., 1 inch = 1 mile)
5. Fill in details with subsequent trips
6. Compare with others' observations, reconcile differences

Include practical information: travel times, water sources, hazards, resources.

### Communication and Signaling

Transportation networks need communication to coordinate.

**Visual Signals**

- Flags: Color-coded messages visible over distance
- Fires/smoke: Night fires or day smoke signals (agreed patterns convey messages)
- Heliograph: Reflect sunlight with mirror to flash messages (Morse code)

**Message Riders**

Establish message routes. Regular riders carry news, letters, and information between settlements. This creates information network alongside physical transport.

**Way Stations**

Every 20-30 miles along major routes, establish way stations: shelter, food, fresh horses/oxen. These enable long-distance travel by breaking journeys into stages.

## Winter Transportation (Cold Climate Adaptations)

In cold climates, winter transforms transportation. Wheeled vehicles become impractical, but snow and ice create new opportunities.

### Sleighs and Sleds

Runners have lower friction on snow than wheels. A horse pulling a sleigh moves loads as easily in winter as a wheeled cart in summer.

**Basic Sled Construction**:

Simplest sled:
- Two parallel runners (hardwood or metal-shod wood)
- Cross-pieces connecting runners (creates platform)
- Upcurved front ends (prevents digging into snow)

*Runners*:
- Hardwood (oak, ash, hickory) 2x6 or 2x8 inches, 6-10 feet long
- Steam-bend or cut front curve (upward turn prevents catching)
- Shoe bottom surface with metal strips (steel or iron) for durability and reduced friction
- Space runners 30-40 inches apart (track width)

*Cross-members*:
- Bolt or mortise cross-pieces between runners every 18-24 inches
- Creates rigid platform
- Add planking or box on top for cargo

*Shafts or tongue*:
- Attach pulling apparatus (like wagon shafts)
- Can be shafts for single horse or tongue for team

**Load Capacity**:

On packed snow or ice:
- Horse-drawn sled: 1-2 tons (more than equivalent wheeled cart on dry ground!)
- Oxen-drawn sled: 2-4 tons
- Human-drawn sled: 200-400 lbs

The friction coefficient on ice/packed snow is very low (~0.02-0.05), making heavy loads practical.

**Sleigh Improvements**:

*Passenger sleigh*:
- Enclosed box with seating
- Blankets and heated stones for warmth
- Bells to warn others (visibility poor in snowstorms)

*Cargo sleigh*:
- High-sided bed
- Removable stakes
- Brake (drag beneath runner, operated by lever)

### Ice Roads

Frozen lakes and rivers become highways in winter.

**Advantages**:
- Perfectly level surface
- No road construction needed
- Allows travel across water barriers
- Massive load capacity (thick ice supports immense weight)

**Ice Thickness Safety**:

Minimum ice thickness for:
- **Walking**: 4 inches of clear ice
- **Snowmobile/ATV**: 5-6 inches
- **Small car**: 8-12 inches
- **Medium truck**: 12-15 inches
- **Loaded wagon**: 12-18 inches
- **Heavy loads (tons)**: 24+ inches

Test ice thickness before traveling:
- Drill/chop test holes regularly
- Clear ice (frozen water) is stronger than white ice (frozen snow)
- Avoid ice near inlets, outlets, or springs (weaker)
- Morning is safer than afternoon (ice softens in sun)

**Ice Road Maintenance**:
- Clear snow (insulates ice, prevents thickening)
- Mark route with stakes or flags
- Monitor weather (warming trends weaken ice)
- Establish thickness checking schedule

**Hazards**:
- Pressure cracks (ice expands/contracts with temperature)
- Weak spots over currents
- Sudden thaws
- Overflow (water on top of ice under snow)

If ice breaks:
- Don't panic
- Spread weight (lay flat)
- Crawl to shore or thicker ice
- Keep tools/rope to aid self-rescue

### Draft Animal Winter Care

Working animals need extra care in cold:

**Increased Feed**:
- Animals burn more calories staying warm
- Increase grain ration 25-50% in cold weather
- Ensure adequate roughage (hay provides warmth through digestion)

**Shelter**:
- Wind protection essential (three-sided shed minimum)
- Bedding (straw, hay) for insulation from frozen ground
- Access to unfrozen water (break ice regularly or provide heated water)

**Blankets**:
- Wool or canvas blankets for horses
- Oxen need less (heavy coat) but may need coverage in extreme cold
- Use when stationary; remove when working (sweating under blanket = chilling)

**Hoof Care**:
- Ice balls pack in hooves (painful, causes slipping)
- Apply grease to hooves before travel (prevents snow packing)
- Use winter shoes (studs or cleats for traction on ice)

**Frostbite Prevention**:
- Watch ears, muzzle, coronary band (tops of hooves)
- Shelter during extreme cold
- Don't work to exhaustion (fatigued animals chill faster)

### Snowshoes and Skis (Human-Powered)

Deep snow makes walking impossible. Snowshoes and skis distribute weight.

*Snowshoes*:
- Wooden frame with webbing (rawhide, cordage)
- Typical size: 12 inches wide, 30-36 inches long
- Larger for soft snow, smaller for packed snow
- Allows walking on surface where feet would sink 2-3 feet

*Skis*:
- Long, narrow wooden runners (6-8 feet long, 3-4 inches wide)
- Bindings attach boots
- Allows gliding over snow
- Faster than snowshoes once learned
- Better for flat or downhill travel

### Specialized Winter Equipment

*Brakes for Sleds*:
- Essential on slopes (sled accelerates downhill)
- Drag plate beneath runner
- Spike/claw that digs into snow
- Chain dragging behind

*Cargo Securing*:
- Ropes may freeze stiff
- Use chains or wire in extreme cold
- Extra tie-downs (cargo shifts more easily on smooth sled)

*Visibility*:
- Bright flags/banners on vehicles
- Bells on harness (sound warning in poor visibility)
- Travel in groups (easier to find if one gets lost/stuck)

### Winter Hazards

*Avalanche* (mountainous areas):
- Avoid steep slopes after heavy snow
- Travel ridges or valley floors
- Listen for sliding snow sounds

*Whiteout* (blizzard, blowing snow):
- Zero visibility
- Stop, shelter, wait it out
- Do not attempt travel (easy to get lost 100 yards from destination)

*Freezing/Hypothermia*:
- Wet = death in cold
- Change wet clothing immediately
- Keep spare dry clothes
- Know shelter locations

## Load Securing (Preventing Cargo Disasters)

Cargo that shifts during transport damages goods, destabilizes vehicles, and can cause crashes. Proper securing is essential.

### Rope Tie-Down Patterns

**X-Pattern**:
- For flat loads on wagons/carts
- Cross ropes over load in X pattern
- Anchor to opposite sides of vehicle
- Creates downward pressure and side-to-side restraint
- Use multiple X patterns for long loads

**Web Pattern**:
- Network of ropes over irregular loads
- Anchor to multiple points on vehicle
- Creates containment system
- Good for mixed cargo

**Trucker's Hitch**:
- Knot creates mechanical advantage (pulley effect)
- Allows very tight tensioning
- Essential knot to learn for load securing

How to tie:
1. Create loop in standing part of rope
2. Run working end through loop
3. Pull tight (2:1 mechanical advantage)
4. Secure with half-hitches

### Cargo Netting

Improvised cargo net:
- Weave rope or cord into grid pattern (12-18 inch squares)
- Knot intersections
- Throw over load, tie corners to vehicle
- Excellent for containing many small items

### Weight Distribution Principles

**Vertical Distribution** (prevent toppling):
- Heavy items on bottom
- Light items on top
- Lower center of gravity = more stable vehicle

**Horizontal Distribution** (prevent nose/tail heaviness):
- Balance load front-to-back
- Overloading front or rear affects steering and pulling
- Axle should be slightly forward of load center (slight tongue weight)

**Side-to-Side Balance**:
- Equal weight left and right
- Unbalanced load tilts vehicle, stresses one wheel bearing
- On carts and wagons, measure load sides match within 10-20 lbs

### Liquid Cargo Considerations

Liquids slosh, which affects handling:

*Containers*:
- Use baffled containers (internal divisions reduce sloshing)
- Fill completely (no air space = no sloshing) or partly (<50% allows movement without impact)
- Secure containers cannot tip

*Vehicle Handling*:
- Sloshing fluid makes wagon feel unstable
- Slower starts and stops
- Avoid sudden turns (fluid momentum continues)

### Securing Different Cargo Types

**Grain/Bulk Materials**:
- Use high-sided wagon or bins
- Tarp over top (prevents spilling, protects from weather)
- Tie tarp securely (flapping tarp spooks animals)

**Lumber**:
- Stack with cross-pieces between layers (prevents shifting)
- Bind with chains or heavy rope
- Long lumber should overhang equally front and rear

**Barrels/Casks**:
- Roll into position (heavy!)
- Chock with blocks to prevent rolling
- Tie down individually
- Stand upright when possible (lower center of gravity)

**Livestock**:
- Use crate or enclosed wagon
- Adequate ventilation
- Bedding for cushioning and waste absorption
- Water/feed for long trips
- Don't overload (animals need space to balance during movement)

**Fragile Goods**:
- Pack in straw, hay, or cloth padding
- Use crates or boxes
- Secure to prevent jostling
- Drive slowly on rough roads

### Before Every Trip Checklist

1. **Load secured?**
   - Pull on ropes/chains (should be very tight)
   - Shake load (should not shift)
   - Check knots (properly tied and tightened)

2. **Weight distributed?**
   - Vehicle level side-to-side
   - Balanced front-to-back
   - Nothing overhanging dangerously

3. **Harness/vehicle inspected?**
   - No worn straps
   - Wheels spin freely
   - Brakes functional (if applicable)

4. **Load visible to driver?**
   - Can see ahead of load
   - Can access brake lever
   - Can dismount quickly if needed

### Consequences of Poor Securing

**Shifted load**:
- Vehicle tips/overturns
- Injures or kills animals, driver, bystanders
- Destroys cargo
- Blocks road

**Lost cargo**:
- Spills on road
- Irrecoverable loss
- Creates hazard for others

Prevention through proper securing is always easier than dealing with consequences.

## Load Planning (Before You Leave)

Proper load planning prevents most transportation failures. Plan before loading, not while loading.

### Weight Limits by Vehicle Type

**Know your maximums** (conservative estimates for safety):

*Human-carried*:
- Backpack: 40-50 lbs (1/3 body weight maximum for sustained travel)
- Hand-carry: 20-30 lbs for any distance
- Exceeding these: Injury, exhaustion, slow travel

*Human-powered vehicles*:
- Bicycle (rider + cargo): 250-300 lbs total
- Cargo bicycle (heavy frame): 400 lbs
- Wheelbarrow: 200-300 lbs (depends on wheel/tire quality)
- Hand cart (two-wheeled): 400-600 lbs

*Animal-powered (single animal)*:
- Horse cart: 1,000-1,500 lbs
- Horse wagon (four wheels): 2,000-2,500 lbs
- Ox cart: 1,500-2,000 lbs
- Ox wagon: 3,000-4,000 lbs
- Donkey cart: 600-800 lbs
- Pack animal (horse/mule): 150-200 lbs
- Pack animal (donkey): 100-150 lbs

*Animal-powered (team)*:
- Two-horse wagon: 4,000-5,000 lbs
- Four-ox wagon: 6,000-8,000 lbs
- Multiply by team size, but efficiency doesn't scale perfectly (more animals = more coordination difficulty)

*Water transport*:
- Canoe: 400-600 lbs
- Rowboat: 1,000-2,000 lbs
- Sailing vessel (20 ft): 5,000-10,000 lbs
- Barge (unpowered): 20-50 tons (but requires towing)

**Critical rule**: These are maximum capacities on good roads/water. Reduce by 50% for:
- Rough terrain
- Steep grades
- Sustained travel (vs. short haul)
- High temperatures (animals overheat)
- Poor vehicle/animal condition

### Balance Requirements

**Vertical balance** (top-heavy loads):
- Keep center of gravity low (heavy items on bottom)
- Tall loads tip on slopes, turns, rough ground
- Maximum safe height: 1.5x vehicle width
- Example: 4-foot-wide wagon → maximum 6-foot load height
- Violating this: Overturn risk, especially on slopes

**Horizontal balance** (front-to-back):
- Two-wheeled vehicles (carts): Balance point just behind axle
  - Too far forward: Lifts the shafts (animal can't control)
  - Too far back: Heavy tongue weight (animal exhausted)
  - Test: When shafts are horizontal, cart should balance with slight tongue weight (10-15% of load)
- Four-wheeled vehicles (wagons): Distribute evenly or slightly forward
  - Front-heavy: Front axle overloaded (breaks first)
  - Back-heavy: Rear wheels sink, front wheels lose traction on hills
  - Ideal: 55% front, 45% rear (front axle carries more)

**Side-to-side balance**:
- Must be nearly perfect (within 5%)
- Off-balance: Vehicle pulls to heavy side, tips on slopes
- Check: Measure height of vehicle body on left vs. right when loaded
- Common error: Loading from one side only (heavy items all left)

### Securing Methods by Cargo Type

**Rigid cargo (lumber, pipes, metal stock)**:
- Cradle supports every 4-6 feet
- Cross-ties prevent rolling
- Rope in X-pattern over top
- Danger: Rolling off (cylindrical), sliding (smooth surfaces)

**Flexible cargo (sacks, bundles)**:
- Stack in interlocking pattern (like bricks)
- Tie adjacent sacks together before loading
- Net or rope web over entire load
- Danger: Shifting, especially on rough roads

**Bagged cargo (grain, flour, sand)**:
- Place bags lengthwise (not crosswise) to vehicle direction
- Stack in pyramid (wider base, narrow top)
- Tie downs every two layers
- Danger: Bags burst (replace damaged bags before loading), shifting

**Barrels/casks**:
- Chock with wooden wedges to prevent rolling
- Strap or rope around barrel circumference, tied to vehicle
- Never stack more than 2 high (stability)
- Danger: Rolling (catastrophic), shifting, spilling if not sealed

**Livestock**:
- Partitions prevent trampling, shifting
- Head room (animals panic if enclosed too tightly)
- Ventilation essential
- Tie large animals (prevents sudden movement)
- Load/unload ramps (prevent injury)
- Danger: Shifting (animals move), injury from falls, vehicle damage from panic

**Fragile cargo (pottery, glassware, instruments)**:
- Padding on all sides (straw, cloth, sawdust)
- Rigid crate (prevents crushing)
- Suspend in center of vehicle (not against sides where vibration is highest)
- Minimize vehicle speed (fragile cargo breaks from vibration, not just impacts)
- Danger: Breakage from vibration (the silent killer)

**Liquids (water, fuel, chemicals)**:
- Sealed containers only (sloshing liquid destabilizes vehicle)
- Partially filled containers are worst (maximum slosh)
- Either completely full or less than 1/3 full
- Secure containers against tipping
- Double containment for hazardous liquids (outer barrel catches spills)
- Danger: Sloshing (vehicle control loss), spills, contamination

**Hazardous cargo (flammables, corrosives, poisons)**:
- Separate from other cargo (especially food)
- Label clearly
- Secure against spills
- Plan route avoiding populated areas if possible
- Inform handlers of hazards
- Danger: Fire, poisoning, environmental damage

### Load Planning Checklist

**Before loading**:

1. **Inspect vehicle**:
   - Wheels (cracks, spoke tension, bearing grease)
   - Axles (cracks, bearing wear)
   - Frame (damage, rot)
   - Brakes (function, shoe wear)
   - If any component questionable: Fix before loading

2. **Inspect animal** (if animal-powered):
   - Hooves (cracks, stones, proper shoeing)
   - Legs (swelling, heat, lameness)
   - Harness (fit, wear, sores)
   - Energy level (rested, fed, watered)
   - If animal tired or injured: Rest before traveling

3. **Calculate load weight**:
   - Weigh cargo if possible (scale, or estimate conservatively)
   - Add: Vehicle weight + cargo weight + passengers = total
   - Compare to vehicle/animal capacity
   - If over capacity: Remove cargo or make multiple trips

4. **Plan route**:
   - Distance (can animal/vehicle complete it?)
   - Terrain (steep grades, rough roads reduce capacity)
   - Water crossings (can vehicle ford safely?)
   - Rest stops (animals need rest every 2-3 hours)
   - Alternate routes (if primary blocked)

**During loading**:

1. **Heavy items first, on bottom, centered**
2. **Build up in layers, checking balance each layer**
3. **Secure each layer before adding next**
4. **Stop when at capacity** (don't add "just one more")

**Before departure**:

1. **Walk around vehicle**:
   - Visual inspection of balance (does it look tilted?)
   - Test securing (tug on ropes—should be tight)
   - Check animal attachment (traces secure, collar positioned)

2. **Test brakes** (apply and release, ensure function)

3. **Trial movement**:
   - Move 50 feet slowly
   - Stop
   - Recheck all securing (ropes settle after initial movement)
   - Retighten as needed

**During travel**:

1. **Periodic checks**:
   - Every 30 minutes: Visual inspection of load, animal
   - Every 2 hours: Stop, detailed inspection, retighten ropes, rest animal
   - After rough sections: Immediate check

2. **Adjust to conditions**:
   - Steep descent: Reduce speed, check brakes before descent
   - Rough terrain: Reduce speed, watch for shifting
   - Heat: Rest animal more frequently, reduce pace

### Load Distribution Examples

**Bad load (common mistakes)**:

Example 1: Cart loaded with 500 lbs of grain in sacks
- All sacks on front of cart → front axle overloaded → axle breaks
- Correct: Distribute 60% front, 40% rear

Example 2: Wagon loaded with barrels
- Barrels stacked 3 high → top-heavy → tips on slope → disaster
- Correct: Maximum 2 high, wide base

Example 3: Pack animal with unbalanced load
- 100 lbs on left side, 60 lbs on right → animal leans, sores develop, refuses to move
- Correct: 80 lbs each side (within 5%)

**Good load (proper planning)**:

Example 1: Mixed cargo on wagon
- Bottom layer: Heavy sacks (grain) centered, distributed evenly
- Middle layer: Medium-weight boxes, balanced left-right
- Top layer: Light bundles (cloth, straw), secured with net
- Result: Low center of gravity, balanced, stable

Example 2: Lumber on cart
- Lumber laid flat (not standing)
- Cradles every 5 feet
- Cross-ties prevent rolling
- Roped down with X-pattern
- Result: Secure, low profile, stable

### Weight Estimation Without Scales

**Volume-based estimation** (rough):

- Water: 8 lbs per gallon, 62 lbs per cubic foot
- Grain (wheat, corn): 50-60 lbs per bushel, 45 lbs per cubic foot
- Flour: 40 lbs per bushel
- Hay: 5-10 lbs per cubic foot (varies by compression)
- Wood (seasoned hardwood): 40-50 lbs per cubic foot
- Wood (softwood): 25-30 lbs per cubic foot
- Iron/steel: 490 lbs per cubic foot
- Copper: 560 lbs per cubic foot
- Stone: 150-170 lbs per cubic foot

**Method**: Measure cargo volume (length × width × height), multiply by density.

**Example**: Oak lumber, 10 boards, each 2" × 8" × 12 feet
- Volume per board: (2/12) × (8/12) × 12 = 1.33 cubic feet
- Total volume: 10 × 1.33 = 13.3 cubic feet
- Weight: 13.3 × 45 lbs/ft³ = ~600 lbs

**Comparison method** (no math):
- Lift a known weight (50 lb bag)
- Lift unknown cargo
- Estimate: "This feels like three 50 lb bags" → 150 lbs

### Consequences of Poor Planning

**Overloading**:
- Immediate: Broken axles, injured animals, inability to move
- Delayed: Accelerated wear, chronic animal injuries

**Imbalance**:
- Vehicle overturn (can kill passengers, destroy cargo)
- Loss of control on slopes
- Uneven wear (one axle fails early)

**Poor securing**:
- Shifting cargo (overturn risk)
- Lost cargo (economic loss)
- Hazards for others (cargo falling onto road)

**Inadequate route planning**:
- Stranded (animal exhausted, vehicle stuck)
- Dangerous detours
- Missed delivery windows

**The pattern**: Poor planning creates cascading problems. An overloaded, poorly secured wagon on a poorly planned route fails catastrophically. Good planning prevents most failures.

**Start conservative**: It's better to make two trips with light loads than one trip with overload ending in broken equipment and injured animals.

## Transportation Failure Modes (Know What Kills Systems)

Transportation systems fail in predictable ways. Understanding failure modes prevents disasters and guides maintenance priorities.

### Wheel Failures

**Spoke breakage**:
- Causes: Overtension, impact damage, corrosion, fatigue
- Warning signs: Clicking noise, wheel wobble, loose spokes
- Consequences: One spoke breaks, load redistributes to adjacent spokes, cascading failure
- Prevention: Regular tension checks, replace at first sign of looseness
- Emergency repair: Remove broken spoke, retension remaining spokes, reduce load, travel slowly to workshop

**Rim failure (cracking or collapse)**:
- Causes: Overload, impacts (potholes, rocks), corrosion, metal fatigue
- Warning signs: Visible cracks near spoke holes, permanent deformation
- Consequences: Catastrophic—wheel collapses suddenly under load
- Prevention: Inspect rims regularly for cracks, never exceed load rating
- No field repair—requires complete wheel replacement

**Hub bearing failure**:
- Causes: Lack of lubrication, water intrusion, dirt contamination, wear
- Warning signs: Grinding noise, roughness when spinning wheel, wheel wobble
- Consequences: Increased friction (harder to move), eventual seizure (wheel locks)
- Prevention: Regular greasing (every 500-1000 miles or 6 months), keep grease seals intact
- Field repair: Disassemble hub, clean bearings, repack with grease (carry grease and tools)

### Axle Failures

**Axle breakage**:
- Causes: Overload, metal fatigue, corrosion, impact stress
- Warning signs: Cracking noises, vehicle listing to one side, visible cracks in axle
- Consequences: Catastrophic—wheel detaches, vehicle collapses, possible rollover
- Prevention: Inspect axles for cracks regularly, especially at stress points (wheel mounts, load points)
- Emergency repair: None safe—vehicle inoperable until axle replaced

**Axle bearing wear**:
- Causes: Lack of lubrication, misalignment, overload
- Warning signs: Squeaking/grinding, excessive play when rocking wheel
- Consequences: Wheel wobble, potential axle seizure or breakage
- Prevention: Regular greasing, proper alignment, load distribution
- Field repair: Regrease bearings if caught early

### Harness Failures (Draft Animals)

**Collar breakage or poor fit**:
- Causes: Worn leather, improper sizing, overload
- Warning signs: Chafing, sores on animal, visible cracks in leather
- Consequences: Animal injured (sores → infection → death), loss of pulling power
- Prevention: Daily inspection, proper fitting, regular leather conditioning
- Field repair: Padding with cloth, emergency stitching (but retire harness soon)

**Trace chain/strap failure**:
- Causes: Corrosion (chains), rot (leather straps), overload
- Warning signs: Rust on chains, cracking leather, fraying
- Consequences: Loss of connection to load, potential runaway vehicle on downhill
- Prevention: Regular inspection, replace at first sign of weakness
- Field repair: Rope temporary replacement (but reduce load significantly)

**Bit or bridle failure**:
- Causes: Worn leather, metal fatigue, improper fitting
- Warning signs: Fraying, rust, animal head-tossing
- Consequences: Loss of control, potential runaway
- Prevention: Daily inspection, proper fitting
- Field repair: Rope halter improvisation (reduces control precision)

### Brake Failures

**Brake shoe wear**:
- Causes: Normal use, wet conditions (accelerates wear)
- Warning signs: Reduced braking power, longer stopping distances
- Consequences: Cannot control descent, potential runaway on hills
- Prevention: Regular inspection, carry replacement brake shoes
- Field repair: Replace worn shoes (if spares available), otherwise avoid steep terrain

**Brake linkage failure**:
- Causes: Pin wear, rod bending, cable fraying
- Warning signs: Loose brake lever, uneven braking, visible wear
- Consequences: Complete brake failure
- Prevention: Regular inspection, lubrication of pivot points
- Field repair: Wire improvisation for cables, rope for emergency (but very dangerous—avoid hills)

**Brake drum/rim overheating**:
- Causes: Extended braking (long downhill), overload
- Warning signs: Smoke, burning smell, brake fade (reduced stopping power)
- Consequences: Brake failure from overheating, potential fire
- Prevention: Use drag shoe or rough-locking on long descents, avoid continuous braking
- Field repair: Stop, allow cooling (30+ minutes), reduce speed drastically

### Animal Injuries/Failures

**Lameness**:
- Causes: Stone bruises, hoof cracks, leg injuries, overwork
- Warning signs: Limping, reluctance to move, swelling
- Consequences: Loss of transport capability, potential permanent injury
- Prevention: Regular hoof care, avoid overwork, proper shoeing
- Field response: Stop immediately, inspect hoof/leg, rest animal, reduce load

**Heat exhaustion/overwork**:
- Causes: Working in high heat, insufficient water, overload, too fast pace
- Warning signs: Heavy breathing, staggering, unwillingness to continue
- Consequences: Collapse, death (animals die from overwork)
- Prevention: Frequent rest, ample water, adjust workload to conditions
- Field response: Stop immediately, water, shade, prolonged rest

**Harness sores**:
- Causes: Poor fit, dirt under harness, prolonged work without rest
- Warning signs: Raw spots, swelling, animal flinching when harnessed
- Consequences: Infection, inability to work, potential death from infection
- Prevention: Daily inspection, proper fit, clean harness, rest days
- Field response: Remove harness immediately, clean wound, rest animal until healed

### Load Failures

**Shifting cargo**:
- Causes: Poor securing, unbalanced loading, rope loosening
- Warning signs: Vehicle listing, creaking, visible rope slack
- Consequences: Vehicle overturn, cargo damage, loss
- Prevention: Proper tie-down, regular checks during travel
- Field repair: Stop immediately, rebalance and resecure

**Overload**:
- Causes: Exceeding vehicle/animal capacity, adding cargo incrementally
- Warning signs: Excessive strain on animal, wheel/axle flexing, difficulty moving
- Consequences: Broken axles, injured animals, stuck vehicle
- Prevention: Know and respect load limits, weigh cargo
- Field repair: Remove cargo, cache for later retrieval

### Common-Cause Failures

**Water damage** (affects wheels, axles, harnesses, loads):
- Causes: River crossings, rain, storage in wet conditions
- Consequences: Rust (metal), rot (wood/leather), softening (rope)
- Prevention: Dry equipment after exposure, oil metal parts, shelter storage
- Ongoing maintenance critical

**Lack of lubrication** (affects bearings, axles, chains):
- Causes: Neglect, lubricant depletion, contamination
- Consequences: Friction, wear, eventual seizure
- Prevention: Regular greasing schedule (weekly for heavy use), carry spare lubricant
- Catches many operators—"it's still working" until it suddenly isn't

### Failure Cascades (One Failure Triggers Others)

**Broken spoke → wheel collapse**:
- Single spoke breaks → load transfers → more spokes break → rim deforms → catastrophic failure
- Time to cascade: Hours to days
- Prevention: Fix spoke breaks immediately

**Brake fade → overheating → complete failure**:
- Brakes overheat → reduced friction → more braking needed → more heat → failure
- Time to cascade: Minutes on long descent
- Prevention: Use drag shoe, control speed before descent starts

**Harness sore → infection → death**:
- Minor chafing → open wound → infection → systemic infection → death
- Time to cascade: Days to weeks
- Prevention: Daily inspection, immediate treatment of sores

### Maintenance vs. Emergency Repair Philosophy

**Maintenance prevents failures**. Emergency repairs get you home but don't fix the underlying problem.

**Daily inspection checklist**:
- Wheels: Spin wheels, check for wobble, squeeze spokes for tension, inspect rims for cracks
- Axles: Check for play, listen for grinding, inspect for cracks
- Harness: Check leather for cracks, metal for rust, fit for sores on animal
- Brakes: Test function, inspect shoes for wear, check linkage
- Cargo: Check tie-downs for slack, balance
- Animal: Check hooves, legs, breathing, energy level

**Weekly maintenance**:
- Grease all bearings
- Oil all metal parts
- Condition leather
- Tighten all fasteners
- Check spoke tension and true wheels
- Rest animals

**Monthly inspection**:
- Complete disassembly of critical components (hubs, brakes)
- Replace worn parts before failure
- Detailed inspection for cracks, corrosion, wear

**The pattern**: Failures start small and grow. Catch them early through regular inspection. Deferred maintenance eventually stops you completely—usually at the worst possible time and place.

- Water transport where available
- Potentially early rail or steam-powered transport on critical routes
- Comprehensive maps and navigation
- Established way stations and supporting infrastructure

This creates the foundation for larger-scale trade, knowledge exchange, and coordinated development. Transportation transforms isolated survival communities into the nodes of rebuilding civilization.

## Critical Success Factors

**Maintain Infrastructure**

Transport infrastructure degrades quickly without maintenance. Establish regular maintenance schedules and responsible parties. A washed-out bridge or impassable road breaks networks immediately.

**Document Knowledge**

Record construction techniques, routes, navigation information. Written instructions allow knowledge transfer. Don't let critical skills exist only in one person's memory.

**Start Simple, Progress Methodically**

Don't attempt complex projects before mastering basics. Walk before running. A fleet of wheelbarrows is more valuable early on than one sophisticated but unreliable wagon.

**Think in Networks**

Individual transport means are less valuable than coordinated networks. A road to nowhere helps no one. Plan routes connecting communities and resources.

**Balance Maintenance and New Construction**

Maintaining salvaged equipment and infrastructure is often easier than building new. But salvage is finite. Transition gradually toward manufactured replacements before salvage exhausts.

**Preserve Specialized Knowledge**

Vehicle mechanics, boat builders, farriers, wheelwrights, harness makers—these specialists are force multipliers. Ensure knowledge passes to apprentices.

## Conclusion

Transportation is civilization's circulatory system. It moves resources from source to need. It distributes surpluses and fills shortages. It allows specialization by connecting craftsmen with markets. It spreads knowledge by allowing teachers, books, and techniques to travel.

Begin with what you can do immediately: walk, bicycle, push carts. Progress to draft animals and wagons. Develop watercraft. Maintain roads. Each step multiplies capability. Each connection established makes both ends more valuable.

The community that establishes reliable transport first gains tremendous advantage. They access more resources. They know more (through contact with others). They trade more effectively. They attract specialists who need networks to serve multiple communities.

Transportation isn't glamorous. It's dirty work: maintaining harnesses, repairing wheels, clearing roads, dredging boat channels. But it's fundamental. Without it, you're limited to what one person can carry on their back. With it, you can rebuild the world.

Build your transportation systems methodically. Start now. Every cart built, every horse trained, every road cleared increases your community's resilience and potential. Transportation doesn't just move things—it moves you forward, from survival toward renewal.
