# Chapter 2.6: Mechanical Systems

## The Hidden Foundation

Every machine you'll build—every water wheel, every lathe, every pump, every vehicle—depends on mechanical systems. Gears transmit power. Bearings allow rotation. Linkages convert motion. Seals contain fluids. These are the invisible foundations that make everything else possible.

This chapter is often assumed rather than taught. Pre-collapse engineers learned these fundamentals in school, but that knowledge dies with them unless explicitly preserved. A community that can smelt iron but can't design a proper gear train has only half the capability they need.

## Power Transmission Fundamentals

### The Problem of Power

You have a water wheel turning at 10 RPM. You need a grindstone turning at 100 RPM. You have a hand crank producing rotary motion. You need a saw blade moving back and forth. You have an ox walking in circles. You need a pump moving up and down.

This is the fundamental challenge of mechanical engineering: **converting available motion into useful motion**. The solutions are gears, pulleys, linkages, and cams—technologies that humanity developed over millennia and that you must now rebuild.

### Types of Motion

**Rotary Motion**: Spinning around an axis
- Water wheels, flywheels, shafts
- Measured in RPM (revolutions per minute) or radians/second

**Linear Motion**: Moving in a straight line
- Pistons, saw blades, ram presses
- Measured in distance per unit time (meters/second, feet/minute)

**Reciprocating Motion**: Back-and-forth linear motion
- Pistons, shuttle looms, hand pumps
- Measured in strokes per minute and stroke length

**Oscillating Motion**: Back-and-forth rotary motion (partial rotation)
- Pendulums, escapements, certain lever mechanisms
- Measured in degrees of arc and cycles per minute

### Power, Torque, and Speed

Understanding the relationship between these is critical for designing mechanical systems.

**Power**: The rate of doing work
- Measured in watts, horsepower, or foot-pounds per minute
- Power = Torque × Angular Velocity
- Power is conserved (minus friction losses) through a mechanical system

**Torque**: Rotational force
- Measured in Newton-meters or foot-pounds
- Torque = Force × Lever Arm Distance
- Can be increased by decreasing speed (and vice versa)

**Speed**: How fast something rotates or moves
- Can be increased by decreasing torque (and vice versa)

**The Fundamental Tradeoff**: You cannot get more power out of a system than you put in. You can trade torque for speed, or speed for torque, but power (minus friction) stays constant.

**Example**: A water wheel produces 1 horsepower at 10 RPM with high torque. Through gearing, you can get:
- 100 RPM at 1/10 the torque (same power)
- 1 RPM at 10× the torque (same power)
- NOT 100 RPM at the same torque (that would be 10× the power—impossible)

## Gears

Gears are toothed wheels that transmit rotary motion and torque between shafts. They're the workhorses of mechanical power transmission.

### Gear Fundamentals

**How Gears Work**: Teeth on one gear mesh with teeth on another. As one turns, it drives the other. The gear ratio depends on the number of teeth.

**Gear Ratio**:
```
Gear Ratio = Teeth on Driven Gear / Teeth on Driving Gear
           = Output Torque / Input Torque
           = Input Speed / Output Speed
```

**Example**: A 20-tooth gear driving a 60-tooth gear:
- Gear ratio = 60/20 = 3:1
- Output turns 3× slower than input
- Output has 3× the torque of input
- Direction reverses (external gears)

### Gear Types

#### Spur Gears

The simplest and most common type. Teeth are straight and parallel to the axis.

**Characteristics**:
- Easy to manufacture
- Efficient (minimal friction)
- Can be noisy at high speeds
- Shafts must be parallel

**Applications**:
- Clock mechanisms
- Hand-cranked devices
- Low to medium speed machinery
- Most general applications

**Manufacturing Priority**: Learn to make spur gears first. They're the foundation.

#### Helical Gears

Teeth are cut at an angle to the axis, forming a helix.

**Characteristics**:
- Smoother, quieter operation than spur gears
- Higher load capacity (more teeth in contact)
- Generate axial thrust (requires thrust bearings)
- More difficult to manufacture

**Applications**:
- Automotive transmissions
- High-speed machinery
- Applications requiring smooth power transmission

**Post-Collapse Reality**: Helical gears are difficult to cut without specialized equipment. Use spur gears unless you absolutely need helical.

#### Bevel Gears

Conical gears that transmit power between shafts at an angle (usually 90°).

**Characteristics**:
- Change direction of rotation
- Can have various shaft angles (90° most common)
- More complex to manufacture than spur gears
- Straight or spiral tooth forms

**Applications**:
- Hand drills (brace and bit)
- Vehicle differentials
- Right-angle drives
- Mill mechanisms

**Manufacturing**: Bevel gears require careful geometry. Start with straight-tooth bevels before attempting spiral.

#### Worm Gears

A screw (worm) meshes with a gear (worm wheel). Very high reduction ratios in one stage.

**Characteristics**:
- High gear reduction (10:1 to 100:1 single stage)
- Compact
- Self-locking (worm can drive wheel, but wheel often can't drive worm)
- High friction (requires good lubrication)
- Inefficient compared to other gear types (40-90% efficiency)

**Applications**:
- Hoists and winches (self-locking prevents load from falling)
- Steering mechanisms
- Tuning mechanisms (guitar tuners, valve controls)
- High-reduction applications

**Self-Locking Property**: If the lead angle of the worm is less than the friction angle, the gear train is self-locking. This is valuable for hoists but means you lose some efficiency.

#### Rack and Pinion

A gear (pinion) meshes with a straight toothed bar (rack). Converts rotary to linear motion.

**Characteristics**:
- Converts rotation to translation (or vice versa)
- Linear distance = Pinion circumference × Rotations
- Requires guidance for the rack (slides or ways)

**Applications**:
- Steering mechanisms
- Machine tool feeds
- Gate mechanisms
- Linear actuators

### Gear Tooth Geometry

Proper tooth shape is critical. Wrong geometry causes noise, vibration, wear, and early failure.

#### The Involute Curve

Modern gears use **involute** tooth profiles. An involute is the curve traced by a point on a string as it unwinds from a circle.

**Why Involute?**
- Constant velocity ratio (smooth power transmission)
- Works even if center distance varies slightly
- Standardized—involute gears from different sources mesh together
- Relatively easy to generate with proper tools

**Generating an Involute**:
1. Wrap string around a cylinder (the "base circle")
2. Attach pencil to end of string
3. Keep string taut while unwinding
4. The pencil traces an involute curve

**Practical Application**: You don't draw involutes by hand. You generate them using:
- Gear-cutting machines with proper cutters
- Form cutters shaped to the involute
- Hobbing machines (advanced)

#### Key Gear Terminology

**Pitch Circle**: The theoretical circle on which gear calculations are based. Where teeth effectively mesh.

**Pitch Diameter**: Diameter of the pitch circle.

**Module** (Metric): Pitch diameter divided by number of teeth.
```
Module = Pitch Diameter / Number of Teeth
```

**Diametral Pitch** (Imperial): Number of teeth per inch of pitch diameter.
```
Diametral Pitch = Number of Teeth / Pitch Diameter
```

**Relationship**: Module = 25.4 / Diametral Pitch

**Addendum**: Height of tooth above pitch circle (typically = Module).

**Dedendum**: Depth of tooth below pitch circle (typically = 1.25 × Module).

**Whole Depth**: Total tooth height = Addendum + Dedendum.

**Clearance**: Gap at root of tooth (prevents binding).

**Face Width**: Width of gear (thickness).

**Pressure Angle**: Angle between the line of force and the tangent to the pitch circle. Standard values: 14.5°, 20°, 25°. **20° is most common modern standard.**

**Backlash**: Clearance between mating teeth. Prevents binding but allows some play.

#### Standard Gear Sizes

Standardize on a limited set of modules (or diametral pitches) to enable interchangeability.

**Recommended Metric Modules**:
- 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.25, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 8.0, 10.0

**Recommended Imperial Diametral Pitches**:
- 48, 32, 24, 20, 16, 12, 10, 8, 6, 5, 4, 3

**Pressure Angle**: Standardize on 20° for new construction. 14.5° is older standard (weaker teeth).

**Critical**: All meshing gears must have the same module (or diametral pitch) and pressure angle.

### Gear Manufacturing

#### Method 1: Casting (Simplest)

For large, slow-moving gears where precision isn't critical.

**Process**:
1. Create wooden pattern with gear teeth
2. Make sand mold from pattern
3. Cast in iron or bronze
4. Clean up casting (remove flash, smooth surfaces)
5. No machining of tooth surfaces

**Precision**: Low. Suitable for:
- Water wheel gears
- Mill gearing (large, slow)
- Non-critical applications

**Tooth Quality**: Rough but functional for low-speed applications.

#### Method 2: Form Cutting

Using a cutter shaped to the tooth space (the gap between teeth).

**Process**:
1. Mount gear blank on indexing head (dividing head)
2. Use form cutter shaped to gear tooth space
3. Cut one tooth space
4. Index to next position (rotate blank by 360°/N where N = number of teeth)
5. Repeat for all teeth

**Equipment Needed**:
- Milling machine or shaper
- Indexing head (dividing head)
- Set of form cutters (different cutters for different tooth counts)

**Precision**: Good. Standard method for job-shop gear cutting.

**Cutter Sets**: A single form cutter is only correct for one specific tooth count. In practice, cutters are made in sets covering ranges:
- Cutter #1: 135 teeth to rack
- Cutter #2: 55-134 teeth
- Cutter #3: 35-54 teeth
- Cutter #4: 26-34 teeth
- Cutter #5: 21-25 teeth
- Cutter #6: 17-20 teeth
- Cutter #7: 14-16 teeth
- Cutter #8: 12-13 teeth

**Making Form Cutters**: Advanced metalworking. Requires:
1. Calculate tooth space profile
2. Machine cutter to that profile
3. Harden cutter
4. Sharpen (relief angles for cutting action)

#### Method 3: Gear Hobbing (Advanced)

A hob (special cutting tool shaped like a worm) generates gear teeth. Most efficient for production.

**Advantages**:
- Fast
- Accurate
- One hob cuts any tooth count (same module)
- Continuous cutting action

**Disadvantages**:
- Requires specialized hobbing machine
- Hobs are complex to manufacture

**Post-Collapse Reality**: Hobbing machines are unlikely early. This is Year 20+ technology unless you salvage a working machine.

#### Method 4: Gear Shaping

A cutter shaped like a gear "rolls" against the blank, cutting teeth.

**Advantages**:
- Can cut internal gears
- Good for shoulder gears (can't be hobbed)

**Disadvantages**:
- Slower than hobbing
- Requires gear shaper machine

#### Hand-Cut Gears (Emergency Method)

When you have nothing else, gears can be filed by hand.

**Process**:
1. Calculate tooth spacing (Pitch = π × Pitch Diameter / Number of Teeth)
2. Mark tooth positions around blank circumference
3. File tooth spaces by hand
4. Use gauge to check tooth shape
5. Test mesh with mating gear

**Quality**: Poor but functional for very low-speed applications.

**When to Use**: Desperation. One-off repairs. Learning the geometry.

**Historical Note**: Early clockmakers filed gears by hand. It works—but requires extreme skill and patience.

### Gear Trains

Multiple gears working together to achieve a desired ratio or motion conversion.

#### Simple Gear Train

Gears in sequence, each meshing with the next.

**Calculation**:
```
Overall Ratio = Product of all driven teeth / Product of all driving teeth
```

**Example**: 20T → 40T → 15T → 45T
- Ratio = (40 × 45) / (20 × 15) = 1800/300 = 6:1
- Output turns 6× slower with 6× torque

**Direction**: Each mesh reverses direction. Even number of meshes = same direction. Odd number = opposite.

#### Compound Gear Train

Multiple gears mounted on the same shaft. Allows high ratios in compact space.

**How It Works**:
- Two gears on same shaft turn together (same speed)
- Small gear on shaft drives large gear on next shaft
- Large gear on same shaft drives small gear on next shaft
- Multiplication of ratios

**Example**:
- Shaft 1: 20T gear (input)
- Shaft 2: 60T gear (meshed with Shaft 1), 15T gear (same shaft)
- Shaft 3: 45T gear (meshed with Shaft 2 small gear)
- Ratio: (60/20) × (45/15) = 3 × 3 = 9:1

#### Planetary (Epicyclic) Gears

Complex arrangement with gears orbiting a central gear. Very compact, high ratios.

**Components**:
- **Sun Gear**: Central gear
- **Planet Gears**: Orbit around sun, mesh with sun and ring
- **Ring Gear**: Internal gear, surrounds planets
- **Carrier**: Holds planet gears, rotates with them

**Advantages**:
- Very compact
- High ratios possible
- Multiple gear ratios by holding different elements
- Coaxial input and output

**Disadvantages**:
- Complex to manufacture
- Requires internal gear (ring)
- Precise assembly needed

**Applications**:
- Automatic transmissions
- Bicycle hub gears
- Winches
- Speed reducers

**Post-Collapse**: Advanced. Don't attempt until you've mastered simpler gear trains.

#### Idler Gears

A gear that transmits motion without changing the ratio. Used to:
- Change direction of rotation
- Span distance between shafts
- Maintain mesh between non-adjacent gears

**Key Point**: Idler gears don't affect the gear ratio (same teeth driving and driven cancel out). They only affect direction and spacing.

### Gear Design Considerations

#### Minimum Teeth

Gears with too few teeth have problems:
- **Undercutting**: Base circle larger than dedendum circle, weakens teeth
- **Interference**: Tips of mating gear dig into flanks

**Minimum Teeth** (20° pressure angle):
- For spur gears: 17 teeth minimum without undercutting
- For 14.5° PA: 32 teeth minimum
- Below minimum: Use profile shift (advanced) or accept weaker teeth

#### Face Width

Width of gear affects load capacity.

**Rule of Thumb**: Face width = 8 to 12 × Module (or 2 to 3 / Diametral Pitch)

**Too Narrow**: High stress, rapid wear
**Too Wide**: Uneven load distribution, manufacturing difficulty

#### Material Selection

**Cast Iron**:
- Common for large, slow gears
- Good wear resistance
- Brittle (can't handle shock loads)
- Easy to cast

**Bronze**:
- Excellent for worm wheels (paired with steel worm)
- Good wear properties
- Expensive
- Lower strength than steel

**Steel**:
- Highest strength
- Can be hardened for wear resistance
- Most common for precision gears
- Requires machining (can't cast gear teeth)

**Wood**:
- Historical use in mill gearing
- Quiet operation
- Works with cast iron or other wood
- Limited load capacity
- Requires proper wood selection (apple, hornbeam, maple)

**Wooden Gear Teeth (Cogs)**:
Traditional mill gears often had wooden teeth (cogs) set into a cast iron or wooden wheel. Advantages:
- Replaceable when worn (don't need to replace whole gear)
- Quieter than all-metal
- Some shock absorption

#### Lubrication

See Chapter 2.8 for details. Summary:
- **Enclosed gears**: Oil bath or splash lubrication
- **Open gears**: Heavy grease, applied regularly
- **High-speed gears**: Oil, possibly pressure-fed
- **Worm gears**: Heavy oil, must handle sliding friction

## Bearings

Bearings support rotating shafts and allow smooth motion with minimal friction. Without proper bearings, shafts wear, seize, and destroy machinery.

### Plain Bearings (Bushings)

The simplest bearing: a cylindrical hole that the shaft rotates in.

#### Design Principles

**Clearance**: Gap between shaft and bearing is critical.
- Too tight: Friction, heat, seizure
- Too loose: Vibration, wear, noise
- Rule of thumb: 0.001" to 0.002" per inch of shaft diameter

**Length-to-Diameter Ratio (L/D)**:
- L/D = 1.0 to 2.0 typical
- Longer = more support, more friction
- Shorter = less support, less friction

**Oil Grooves**: Channels in bearing surface distribute lubricant.
- Axial grooves: For continuous oil feed
- Spiral grooves: Pump oil along bearing
- Don't groove the loaded zone (bottom of horizontal shaft)

#### Materials

**Babbitt Metal** (Tin-Lead-Antimony Alloy):
- Soft, conforms to shaft
- Embeds dirt particles (doesn't scratch shaft)
- Excellent for high-load bearings
- Cast into bearing shell, then machined
- Requires re-babbitting when worn

**Bronze**:
- Harder than babbitt
- Good wear resistance
- Self-lubricating varieties (oil-impregnated)
- Standard for medium-duty bearings

**Cast Iron**:
- Cheap
- Adequate for light loads, low speeds
- Requires good lubrication

**Hardwood** (Lignum Vitae, Maple, Oak):
- Self-lubricating (lignum vitae contains natural oils)
- Works in water
- Traditional for water wheels, ship propeller shafts, pumps
- Renewable but requires proper wood species

**Plastic** (if salvageable):
- PTFE (Teflon): Very low friction
- Nylon: Self-lubricating, quiet
- UHMW Polyethylene: Good wear resistance

#### Plain Bearing Applications

**Best for**:
- Heavy loads at low speeds
- Shock loads (soft materials absorb impact)
- Dirty environments (can tolerate some contamination)
- Simple construction
- Where rolling bearings unavailable

**Limitations**:
- Higher friction than rolling bearings
- Require continuous lubrication
- Not suitable for high speeds (heat generation)

### Rolling Element Bearings

Balls or rollers between races reduce friction to a fraction of plain bearings.

#### Ball Bearings

Spherical balls roll between inner and outer races.

**Types**:
- **Deep Groove**: Most common, handles radial and some axial load
- **Angular Contact**: Better axial load capacity, used in pairs
- **Thrust**: Handles only axial (thrust) loads
- **Self-Aligning**: Tolerates shaft misalignment

**Advantages**:
- Very low friction
- High speed capability
- Precise operation
- Long life with proper lubrication

**Disadvantages**:
- Sensitive to contamination (dirt destroys them)
- Limited load capacity for size
- Expensive to manufacture (precision grinding)
- Cannot be made without precision equipment

**Post-Collapse Reality**: Salvage ball bearings. Hoard them. They're nearly impossible to manufacture without advanced grinding equipment. One ball bearing can keep machinery running for decades.

#### Roller Bearings

Cylindrical or tapered rollers instead of balls.

**Types**:
- **Cylindrical Roller**: Higher radial load than ball bearings
- **Tapered Roller**: Handles combined radial and axial loads
- **Needle Roller**: Very compact (thin rollers)
- **Spherical Roller**: Self-aligning, heavy loads

**Advantages over Ball Bearings**:
- Higher load capacity (line contact vs point contact)
- More tolerant of shock loads
- Needle rollers are easier to manufacture than balls

**Disadvantages**:
- Higher friction than ball bearings
- Speed limited compared to ball bearings
- Still require precision manufacture

**Manufacturing Possibility**: Needle bearings are the most achievable rolling bearing to manufacture post-collapse. Cylindrical rollers (needles) are easier to make than perfect spheres.

#### Making Needle Bearings (Achievable Post-Collapse)

**Concept**: Small diameter hardened steel rollers in a cage or loose between races.

**Process**:
1. **Make Rollers**:
   - Turn hardened steel wire to precise diameter on lathe
   - Cut to uniform length
   - Harden if not already hard
   - Polish smooth (tumbling or hand lapping)

2. **Make Races**:
   - Inner race: Can use hardened shaft directly
   - Outer race: Bore hardened tube to size
   - Surface finish critical (polish or grind smooth)

3. **Make Cage** (Optional):
   - Sheet metal with holes for rollers
   - Keeps rollers spaced and aligned
   - Can run without cage (full complement) but limited speed

4. **Assembly**:
   - Insert rollers between races
   - Add cage if using
   - Pack with grease

**Quality**: Homemade needle bearings work but are inferior to manufactured. Use for:
- Non-critical applications
- When salvaged bearings unavailable
- Slow to moderate speeds

#### Bearing Selection

| Application | Bearing Type | Why |
|------------|--------------|-----|
| High speed, light load | Deep groove ball | Low friction |
| Heavy radial load | Cylindrical roller | Line contact |
| Combined load | Tapered roller | Handles both |
| Axial load only | Thrust ball/roller | Designed for it |
| Misalignment expected | Self-aligning | Tolerates error |
| Limited space | Needle roller | Compact |
| Heavy load, low speed | Plain (babbitt/bronze) | Simple, robust |
| Wet environment | Wood or plastic plain | Water-tolerant |

#### Bearing Mounting

**Fits**:
- **Shaft**: Slight interference fit (bearing inner race pressed onto shaft)
- **Housing**: Slight clearance or light interference (outer race in housing)

**Why**: Inner race must not slip on shaft under load. Outer race typically stationary.

**Preload** (for ball/roller bearings):
Some applications require preload (slight compression on bearings) to eliminate play and increase stiffness. Achieved by:
- Shimming
- Adjusting nuts
- Spring loading

**Seals and Shields**:
- Prevent contamination entry
- Retain lubricant
- Shielded bearings have metal covers
- Sealed bearings have rubber seals (better exclusion)

## Shafts and Couplings

Shafts transmit rotary power. Couplings connect shafts together.

### Shaft Design

#### Loading

**Torsion**: Twisting from transmitted torque
**Bending**: From gear forces, belt tension, or overhung loads
**Combined**: Most shafts see both torsion and bending

#### Sizing

**For Pure Torsion**:
```
Shaft Diameter = ∛(16 × Torque / (π × Allowable Stress))
```

**For Combined Loading**: More complex calculation considering both stresses.

**Rule of Thumb**: When in doubt, go larger. An oversized shaft wastes some material but works. An undersized shaft fails catastrophically.

#### Materials

**Steel**: Standard for most applications
- Cold-rolled: Good surface finish, moderate strength
- Hot-rolled: Cheaper, rougher surface
- Alloy steel: Higher strength for demanding applications

**Sizing Steps**:
1. Determine power and speed (gives torque)
2. Identify bending loads (gear forces, belt pulls)
3. Calculate required diameter
4. Round up to standard size
5. Add margin for keyways (stress concentrators)

### Keyways and Keys

Keys lock gears, pulleys, and other components to shafts, transmitting torque.

#### Key Types

**Square Key**: Width = Height = 1/4 shaft diameter (approximate)
- Simple, common
- Keyway weakens shaft (stress concentration)

**Rectangular Key**: Width > Height
- For heavy loads
- Less shaft weakening than square

**Woodruff Key**: Half-moon shape
- Self-aligning
- Easier to fit
- Weaker than square keys

**Gib Head Key**: Square key with head for removal
- Can be driven out from one end

#### Keyway Dimensions

Standard keyway proportions (imperial):

| Shaft Diameter | Key Width | Key Height | Keyway Depth |
|---------------|-----------|------------|--------------|
| 1/2" - 9/16" | 1/8" | 1/8" | 1/16" |
| 5/8" - 7/8" | 3/16" | 3/16" | 3/32" |
| 15/16" - 1-1/4" | 1/4" | 1/4" | 1/8" |
| 1-5/16" - 1-3/8" | 5/16" | 5/16" | 5/32" |
| 1-7/16" - 1-3/4" | 3/8" | 3/8" | 3/16" |
| 1-13/16" - 2-1/4" | 1/2" | 1/2" | 1/4" |

#### Cutting Keyways

**In Shaft**:
- End mill on milling machine
- Slotting attachment on shaper
- Broaching (production method)
- Hand: Chisel and file (slow, inaccurate)

**In Hub (Gear/Pulley)**:
- Broaching (standard production method)
- Slotting on shaper
- Hand filing (last resort)

### Shaft Couplings

Connect two shafts together.

#### Rigid Couplings

No flexibility—requires perfect shaft alignment.

**Sleeve Coupling**: Simple tube pressed over both shafts
- Cheapest
- Requires precise alignment
- Can't be assembled without moving shafts axially

**Flange Coupling**: Flanges bolted together
- Can be assembled/disassembled
- Still requires good alignment
- Common for permanent installations

**Split Coupling**: Clamshell design, clamps around shafts
- No axial movement needed for assembly
- Good for repair situations

#### Flexible Couplings

Accommodate misalignment and absorb shock.

**Jaw Coupling**: Spider (elastomer) between two hubs
- Handles angular and parallel misalignment
- Some shock absorption
- Elastomer wears and needs replacement

**Oldham Coupling**: Three-piece with sliding joints
- Handles parallel misalignment
- No angular misalignment capacity
- Zero backlash

**Universal Joint (U-Joint)**: Handles large angular misalignment
- Used in vehicle drive shafts
- **Speed variation**: Single U-joint causes cyclic speed variation; use in pairs to cancel
- Complex to manufacture

**Flexible Disk Coupling**: Thin metal or rubber disk between hubs
- Handles slight misalignment
- Compact
- Metal disk versions are torsionally stiff

#### Alignment

Even flexible couplings have limits. Good alignment extends life.

**Alignment Methods**:
1. **Straight Edge**: Place across coupling faces, check for gaps
2. **Dial Indicator**: Mount indicator on one shaft, rotate, measure runout on other
3. **Laser Alignment**: Pre-collapse technology, salvage if possible

**Alignment Tolerances** (typical):
- Parallel offset: < 0.005" (0.13mm)
- Angular: < 0.001" per inch of coupling diameter

## Linkages and Mechanisms

Linkages convert one type of motion to another. They're fundamental to machinery from steam engines to sewing machines.

### The Four-Bar Linkage

The fundamental building block of linkage design.

**Components**:
1. **Frame** (Ground Link): Fixed, doesn't move
2. **Crank**: Rotates continuously (or oscillates)
3. **Coupler**: Connects crank to follower
4. **Follower** (Rocker): Output motion

**Behavior**: Depending on link lengths, the four-bar can:
- Convert continuous rotation to oscillation
- Convert oscillation to oscillation
- Generate complex coupler curves

**Grashof Condition**: Determines if a link can rotate fully.
```
S + L ≤ P + Q
Where: S = shortest link, L = longest link, P and Q = other two links
```

If satisfied: At least one link can rotate fully.
If not satisfied: All links only oscillate.

### Slider-Crank Mechanism

Converts rotary motion to linear reciprocating motion (or vice versa).

**Components**:
- Crank (rotating)
- Connecting rod
- Slider (reciprocates in guide)

**Applications**:
- Internal combustion engines (piston to crankshaft)
- Reciprocating pumps
- Reciprocating saws
- Steam engines

**Key Relationships**:
- Stroke = 2 × Crank Radius
- Position varies sinusoidally (approximately)

**Offset Slider-Crank**: Slider axis doesn't pass through crank center. Creates quick-return effect.

### Scotch Yoke

Alternative to slider-crank for converting rotary to linear motion.

**Components**:
- Rotating crank with pin
- Slotted yoke that reciprocates
- Pin slides in slot

**Advantages**:
- Pure sinusoidal motion
- Compact
- Simple

**Disadvantages**:
- Higher friction (sliding pin in slot)
- Wears faster than slider-crank

**Applications**:
- Slow reciprocating mechanisms
- Testing machines
- Some pumps

### Quick-Return Mechanisms

For applications where the return stroke should be faster than the working stroke (shapers, some presses).

#### Whitworth Quick Return

**Components**:
- Rotating crank
- Slotted arm pivoting at offset point
- Slider driven by arm

**Behavior**: Forward stroke slow (cutting), return stroke fast (non-cutting).

**Ratio**: Time forward / Time return = depends on geometry. Ratios of 2:1 are achievable.

#### Crank-Rocker Quick Return

A four-bar linkage designed with unequal times for forward and return oscillation.

### Toggle Mechanisms

Multiply force near the end of stroke. Used in presses, clamps, and switches.

**Principle**: As toggle approaches straight line (180°), mechanical advantage approaches infinity. Small input motion creates large output force.

**Applications**:
- Toggle clamps (holding work)
- Punch presses (multiplying force at bottom of stroke)
- Circuit breakers (snap action)
- Stone crushers

**Design Note**: Toggle mechanisms jam at dead center. Design must include means to pass through dead center (momentum, spring, etc.).

### Straight-Line Mechanisms

Generate approximate or exact straight-line motion from rotary inputs.

#### Watt's Linkage

**Use**: Approximate straight line over limited range.

**Historical Significance**: James Watt invented this for his steam engine to guide the piston rod.

**Components**: Four-bar linkage with specific proportions.

#### Peaucellier-Lipkin Linkage

**Use**: Exact straight line.

**Components**: Eight links in specific arrangement.

**Complexity**: More complex than Watt's but gives true straight line.

**Post-Collapse Application**: For precision machinery requiring true linear motion without slide ways.

### Intermittent Motion Mechanisms

#### Geneva Mechanism

Converts continuous rotation to intermittent rotation.

**Components**:
- Driver with pin
- Geneva wheel (slotted)
- Each rotation of driver advances Geneva by one station

**Applications**:
- Film projectors (advancing film frame by frame)
- Indexing tables
- Sequential operations

**Variations**: 4-station, 6-station, 8-station, etc.

#### Ratchet and Pawl

Allows rotation in only one direction.

**Components**:
- Ratchet wheel (saw-tooth profile)
- Pawl (engages teeth, prevents reverse)

**Applications**:
- Hoists (prevents load from falling)
- Wrenches (socket wrench mechanism)
- Winches
- Clockwork (maintaining power during winding)

**Reversible**: Some designs allow switching direction.

Cams convert rotary motion to precisely controlled linear or oscillating motion.

### Cam Types

#### Plate Cam (Disk Cam)

Rotating disk with profiled edge. Follower rides on edge.

**Applications**:
- Valve timing (engines)
- Sewing machines
- Automated machinery

#### Cylindrical Cam (Drum Cam)

Groove cut in cylinder surface. Follower rides in groove.

**Advantages**:
- Positive motion (follower captured in groove)
- Can generate complex motions

**Applications**:
- Textile machinery
- Packaging machines
- Complex automation

#### Face Cam

Groove cut in face of disk. Similar to cylindrical cam but planar.

### Follower Types

**Knife Edge**: Simple but wears quickly. Only for slow speeds.

**Roller Follower**: Roller rides on cam surface. Lower friction, longer life.

**Flat-Face Follower**: Flat surface contacts cam. Good for high loads.

**Spherical Follower**: Curved surface. Handles misalignment.

### Cam Profiles

The shape of the cam determines follower motion.

**Rise-Dwell-Fall-Dwell**: Common pattern
1. **Rise**: Follower moves outward
2. **Dwell**: Follower stationary (flat on cam)
3. **Fall**: Follower moves inward (returns)
4. **Dwell**: Another stationary period

**Motion Types**:

**Constant Velocity**: Follower moves at constant speed.
- Simple but creates infinite acceleration at start/end (shock)
- Only for very slow applications

**Simple Harmonic**: Sine wave motion.
- Smooth acceleration
- Zero velocity at ends

**Cycloidal**: Based on cycloid curve.
- Zero acceleration at ends (smooth start/stop)
- Best for high-speed cams

**Parabolic (Constant Acceleration)**:
- Constant acceleration/deceleration
- Finite jerk at transitions

### Cam Design Process

1. **Define Motion Requirements**:
   - Total lift (follower travel)
   - Timing (degrees for rise, dwell, fall, dwell)
   - Speed (cam RPM)

2. **Select Motion Type**:
   - Low speed: Constant velocity acceptable
   - Medium speed: Simple harmonic
   - High speed: Cycloidal

3. **Calculate Cam Profile**:
   - For each degree of rotation, calculate follower position
   - Plot points, connect with smooth curve

4. **Add Base Circle**:
   - Minimum radius (follower at lowest position)
   - Profile rides on top of base circle

5. **Check Pressure Angle**:
   - Angle between follower motion and cam surface normal
   - Should be < 30° (forces reasonable)
   - Increase base circle if pressure angle too high

6. **Manufacture**:
   - CNC milling (ideal, salvage machine if possible)
   - Form grinding
   - Hand filing with templates (slow but possible)

### Valve Timing Cams

Critical for internal combustion engines.

**Requirements**:
- Open valve at specific crankshaft position
- Hold open for duration
- Close valve smoothly
- Timing precise to degrees

**Cam Profiles for Valves**: Usually asymmetric (slower opening, faster closing) with dwell at full lift.

**Adjustment**: Cam timing affects engine performance. Adjustable cam sprockets allow fine-tuning.

## Springs

Springs store and release energy, provide force, absorb shock, and return mechanisms to position.

### Spring Types

#### Helical Compression Springs

Coiled wire, resists compression.

**Applications**:
- Valve springs (engines)
- Suspension
- Return springs
- Shock absorption

**Key Parameters**:
- Wire diameter (d)
- Mean coil diameter (D)
- Number of active coils (n)
- Free length
- Solid height (fully compressed)
- Spring rate (k = Force / Deflection)

**Spring Rate Calculation** (approximate):
```
k = G × d⁴ / (8 × D³ × n)

Where:
G = Shear modulus (11.5 × 10⁶ psi for steel)
d = Wire diameter
D = Mean coil diameter
n = Number of active coils
```

#### Helical Extension Springs

Coiled wire, resists extension (pulling).

**Features**:
- Hooks or loops at ends for attachment
- Initial tension (force required to start extending)
- Otherwise similar to compression springs

**Applications**:
- Door closers
- Return mechanisms
- Tension applications

#### Torsion Springs

Coiled wire, resists twisting.

**Applications**:
- Clothespins
- Mousetraps
- Door hinges
- Electrical contacts

**End Forms**: Straight legs that transmit torque.

#### Leaf Springs

Flat strips of spring steel, stacked or single.

**Applications**:
- Vehicle suspension (traditional)
- Clamps
- Contacts

**Design**: Single leaf or multiple leaves clamped together. Leaves slide against each other (lubricate).

#### Constant Force Springs

Rolled strip that provides nearly constant force throughout extension.

**Applications**:
- Counterbalances
- Retractors
- Where constant force needed regardless of position

### Spring Materials

**High-Carbon Steel**: Most common spring material.
- Music wire: Highest quality, best for critical springs
- Oil-tempered wire: Good general purpose
- Hard-drawn wire: Economy grade

**Stainless Steel**: Corrosion resistance.

**Phosphor Bronze**: Electrical conductivity, corrosion resistance.

**Inconel**: High temperature applications.

### Spring Manufacturing

**Coiling**:
1. Start with spring wire of correct diameter
2. Wind around mandrel (diameter = D - d)
3. Maintain consistent pitch (spacing)
4. Cut to length

**Heat Treatment**:
- Springs are typically wound "cold" from pre-hardened wire
- Stress relieving after coiling (mild heating) improves performance
- Don't anneal—destroys spring properties

**End Treatment** (compression springs):
- Ground ends: Flat for stable seating
- Closed ends: Last coil closed against adjacent coil
- Open ends: Last coil same pitch as body

### Spring Design Considerations

**Stress**:
- Maximum stress occurs at inner diameter of coil
- Must stay below material yield strength (with safety margin)
- Fatigue life depends on stress range

**Buckling** (compression springs):
- Long, slender springs buckle under compression
- Guide in tube or over rod if free length / mean diameter > 4

**Surge** (resonance):
- Springs have natural frequency
- Operating frequency must avoid resonance
- Add damping or change spring rate if problematic

**Set**:
- Springs can "take a set" (permanent deformation) if overstressed
- Design maximum deflection below solid height
- Leave clearance (10-15% of solid height minimum)

## Clutches and Brakes

Clutches connect and disconnect power transmission. Brakes stop or slow motion.

### Friction Clutches

#### Cone Clutch

Male cone presses into female cone, friction transmits torque.

**Advantages**:
- Simple
- High torque capacity for size (wedging action)
- Self-energizing

**Disadvantages**:
- Tendency to grab (engage suddenly)
- Wears unevenly
- Engagement force varies with wear

**Applications**: Historical vehicle transmissions, simple machinery.

#### Disk Clutch

Flat disks pressed together by spring or lever.

**Types**:
- **Single plate**: One friction disk
- **Multi-plate**: Multiple disks for higher torque in same diameter

**Advantages**:
- Smooth engagement
- Compact
- Easy to adjust

**Applications**: Vehicle transmissions, power take-offs, machinery.

**Material**:
- Friction surfaces: Leather, cork, woven asbestos (historical), sintered metal
- Post-collapse: Leather is most achievable friction material

#### Centrifugal Clutch

Engages automatically as speed increases.

**Mechanism**:
- Weighted shoes on spider
- At low speed, springs hold shoes in
- At higher speed, centrifugal force throws shoes out against drum
- Friction transmits torque

**Applications**:
- Chain saws
- Go-karts
- Automatic engagement at idle speed

**Advantages**:
- No manual control needed
- Protects engine from stalling

### Dog Clutches

Positive engagement through interlocking teeth.

- Simple, robust
- No wear (no friction during operation)

**Applications**:
- Gear selection (must synchronize speeds first)
- Lathe back-gears
- Positive-lock applications

### One-Way Clutches (Overrunning Clutches)

Transmit torque in one direction, freewheel in other.

#### Sprag Clutch

Sprags (wedge-shaped elements) between inner and outer race. Tilt one direction to lock, other direction to freewheel.

#### Roller Clutch

Rollers in ramped pockets. Roll up ramp to lock, roll down to release.

**Applications**:
- Bicycle freewheels
- Starter motors (disengage after engine starts)
- Backstops (prevent reverse rotation)

### Brakes

#### Band Brake

Flexible band wrapped around drum. Tightening band creates friction.

**Advantages**:
- Simple
- High torque capacity
- Easy to make

**Disadvantages**:
- Self-energizing in one direction (grabby), self-de-energizing in other
- Wears unevenly

**Applications**: Hoists, winches, simple machinery.

#### Drum Brake

Shoes press outward against inside of drum.

**Advantages**:
- Self-enclosed (protected from environment)
- Can be self-energizing
- Handles high loads

**Disadvantages**:
- Heat dissipation limited
- Fades when hot
- Complex to manufacture

**Applications**: Vehicle brakes, industrial machinery.

#### Disk Brake

Pads squeeze flat disk (rotor).

**Advantages**:
- Excellent heat dissipation
- Consistent performance hot or cold
- Easy to inspect
- Simple to replace pads

**Disadvantages**:
- Requires hydraulic or powerful mechanical actuation
- Exposed to environment

**Applications**: Modern vehicle brakes, high-performance machinery.

**Post-Collapse**: Disk brakes are simpler to fabricate than drum brakes. Consider for new designs.

### Brake and Clutch Lining Materials

**Leather**: Traditional, works well with proper maintenance. Keep oiled when not in use (prevents drying), but not too much oil (reduces friction).

**Cork**: Good friction, quiet operation. Mixed with phenolic resin for durability.

**Woven Fiber**: Asbestos-based linings were common (health hazard—avoid). Aramid fiber (Kevlar) is modern alternative but hard to source post-collapse.

**Sintered Metal**: Bronze or iron particles sintered together. High temperature capability, long wear. Requires powder metallurgy.

**Post-Collapse Recommendation**: Leather linings for clutches and brakes. Renewable, repairable, proven technology.

## Hydraulics

Hydraulic systems use pressurized fluid to transmit power. They enable high forces in compact packages.

### Hydraulic Principles

**Pascal's Law**: Pressure applied to enclosed fluid is transmitted equally in all directions.

**Force Multiplication**:
```
Force = Pressure × Area

If small piston (Area A₁) pressurizes fluid, and large piston (Area A₂) receives pressure:
Output Force / Input Force = A₂ / A₁
```

**Example**: 1" diameter input piston, 4" diameter output piston
- Area ratio = π×2² / π×0.5² = 16:1
- 100 lb input = 1600 lb output
- But output moves 1/16 the distance of input (power conserved)

### Hydraulic Components

#### Pumps

Generate flow and pressure.

**Gear Pump**:
- Two meshing gears in housing
- Fluid trapped between gear teeth and housing
- Simple, robust, moderate efficiency (80-90%)
- Most achievable to manufacture post-collapse

**Vane Pump**:
- Vanes slide in rotor slots
- Pressed against housing by springs or centrifugal force
- Higher efficiency than gear pump
- More complex construction

**Piston Pump** (Axial or Radial):
- Pistons reciprocate in cylinder block
- Highest pressure and efficiency
- Most complex
- Variable displacement possible

**Hand Pump**:
- Simple piston pump, manually operated
- For low-volume applications
- Essential for post-collapse hydraulics

#### Cylinders (Actuators)

Convert hydraulic pressure to linear force and motion.

**Single-Acting**: Pressure extends, spring or gravity returns.
**Double-Acting**: Pressure both extends and retracts.

**Components**:
- Cylinder body (tube)
- Piston with seals
- Rod
- End caps with ports
- Rod seals (critical)

**Seals**: See Chapter 2.8. Leather cup seals are achievable post-collapse.

#### Valves

Control direction, pressure, and flow.

**Directional Control Valve**: Routes flow to different ports.
- Spool type: Sliding spool in bore
- Check valve: Allows flow one direction only

**Pressure Relief Valve**: Opens at set pressure to prevent overpressure.
- Spring-loaded ball or poppet
- Critical safety component

**Flow Control Valve**: Restricts flow to control speed.
- Needle valve: Fine adjustment
- Fixed orifice: Simple restriction

#### Reservoir

Stores fluid, allows air separation, cools fluid.

**Sizing**: Typically 2-3× pump flow rate per minute.

**Features**:
- Breather (allows air in/out as level changes)
- Strainer on inlet
- Sight glass for level
- Drain plug

### Hydraulic Fluids

**Petroleum Oil**: Standard hydraulic fluid.
- Good lubrication
- Compatible with most seals
- Wide temperature range
- Flammable

**Vegetable Oil**: Emergency substitute.
- Higher viscosity
- May attack some seals
- Shorter life (oxidizes)

**Water**: Low lubricity, corrosion problems, but non-flammable. Historical hydraulic presses used water.

**Properties That Matter**:
- Viscosity (too thin = leakage, too thick = sluggish)
- Lubricity (protects pumps and cylinders)
- Corrosion protection
- Air release (foamy fluid performs poorly)

### Simple Hydraulic Systems

#### Hydraulic Jack

**Components**:
- Reservoir
- Hand pump (small piston)
- Check valves (inlet and outlet)
- Ram cylinder (large piston)
- Release valve

**Operation**:
1. Pump handle draws fluid through inlet check valve
2. Push handle, fluid flows through outlet check valve to ram
3. Ram extends
4. Open release valve to retract ram

**Post-Collapse Feasibility**: Hydraulic jacks are achievable. Hand pump, simple cylinders, basic check valves. Critical for lifting and pressing operations.

#### Hydraulic Press

Scale up the hydraulic jack for industrial pressing operations.

**Applications**:
- Forging
- Bending
- Punching
- Bearing pressing
- Baling

**Advantages over Mechanical Press**:
- Full force throughout stroke
- Controllable speed
- Overload protection (relief valve)
- Simple structure (no complex linkages)

### Hydraulic System Design

**Pressure Selection**:
- Low pressure (<1000 psi): Simple, achievable seals
- Medium pressure (1000-3000 psi): Standard industrial
- High pressure (3000-10000 psi): Compact, requires precision components

**Post-Collapse Recommendation**: Start with low pressure systems (500-1000 psi). Sealing is easier, safety margin higher, components more forgiving.

**Contamination Control**: Hydraulic systems are sensitive to dirt. Filter fluid, keep system clean, cover reservoir.

**Leakage**: Expect some leakage, especially with primitive seals. Design to contain and return leaked fluid. External leaks waste fluid and create hazards.

## Pneumatics

Pneumatic systems use compressed air. Similar to hydraulics but different characteristics.

### Pneumatics vs. Hydraulics

| Factor | Hydraulics | Pneumatics |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| Fluid | Incompressible (liquid) | Compressible (gas) |
| Force | High forces possible | Lower forces (limited pressure) |
| Speed | Controllable, smooth | Fast, but spongy under load |
| Leakage | Messy, expensive | Just air escaping |
| Storage | Must return to reservoir | Can store energy in tank |
| Cost | Expensive fluid | Free air |
| Contamination | Very sensitive | More tolerant |

### Compressed Air Generation

#### Piston Compressor

Reciprocating piston compresses air.

**Single-Stage**: Compresses directly to final pressure.
- Limited to ~100-125 psi (compression ratio ~8:1)
- Simple

**Two-Stage**: First stage compresses to intermediate pressure, intercooler removes heat, second stage compresses to final pressure.
- Higher pressures achievable (~200 psi or more)
- More efficient for high pressures
- More complex

**Components**:
- Cylinder and piston (similar to engine)
- Inlet valve (reed or poppet)
- Outlet valve
- Drive mechanism (motor, engine, hand-crank)
- Tank (air receiver)
- Pressure relief valve (critical safety)

**Post-Collapse Feasibility**: Piston compressors are achievable. Similar technology to steam engines and pumps.

#### Bellows

Simple manual air compression.

**Applications**:
- Forge bellows (low pressure, high volume)
- Pipe organ bellows
- Simple pneumatic tools

**Advantages**: Very simple, can be made from leather and wood.

### Pneumatic Components

#### Air Receiver (Tank)

Stores compressed air, smooths pulsations from compressor.

**Sizing**: Larger tank = more stored air = compressor cycles less frequently.

**Safety**: Compressed air tanks are pressure vessels. **Failure can be explosive.**
- Hydrotest new tanks (pressure test with water, not air)
- Pressure relief valve required
- Regular inspection for corrosion

#### Regulator

Reduces pressure from tank (high, variable) to working pressure (lower, constant).

**Principle**: Spring-loaded diaphragm balances outlet pressure against spring force.

**Necessity**: Most pneumatic tools need consistent pressure. Regulator provides this despite varying tank pressure.

#### Lubricator

Adds oil mist to air for lubricating pneumatic tools.

**Principle**: Venturi draws oil from reservoir, atomizes into air stream.

**Necessity**: Air cylinders and tools need lubrication. Lubricator automates this.

#### Filter

Removes water and particles from compressed air.

**Principle**: Centrifugal separator spins water out, filter element catches particles.

**Necessity**: Compressing air concentrates moisture. Water rusts tools and washes out lubricant.

**FRL Unit**: Filter-Regulator-Lubricator combined in one assembly. Standard practice for pneumatic systems.

### Pneumatic Actuators

#### Air Cylinders

Similar to hydraulic cylinders but typically lower force.

**Characteristics**:
- Faster than hydraulic (air less viscous)
- "Spongy" under varying loads (air compresses)
- Simpler seals acceptable (air, not oil)

**Force Calculation**:
```
Force = Pressure × Piston Area
```

At 100 psi with 2" diameter piston:
Force = 100 × π × 1² = 314 lbs

#### Air Motors

Convert pneumatic pressure to rotary motion.

**Types**:
- Vane motor (simple, widely used)
- Piston motor (higher torque)
- Gear motor (simple construction)

**Characteristics**:
- High speed possible
- Stall without damage (unlike electric motors)
- Inherently safe in explosive atmospheres
- Low efficiency (25-50%)

### Pneumatic Tools

**Impact Wrench**: Rapid impacts from pneumatic hammer loosen tight fasteners.

**Die Grinder**: High-speed vane motor drives grinding wheel.

**Drill**: Pneumatic motor drives drill bit.

**Nail Gun**: Compressed air drives nail.

**Advantages**:
- No electricity needed
- Lighter than electric equivalents
- Safe in wet environments
- High power-to-weight ratio

**Post-Collapse Relevance**: Pneumatic tools require only a compressor and tank. No electrical infrastructure. Good transition technology between hand tools and electric tools.

### Simple Pneumatic Projects

#### Foot-Operated Air Cylinder

**Application**: Metalworking clamp, small press.

**Components**:
- Air cylinder (salvaged or fabricated)
- Foot pump (bellows or piston)
- Check valve
- Release valve

**Operation**: Pump with foot, cylinder extends and clamps. Release valve allows retraction.

**Advantage**: Hands free for holding workpiece.

#### Pneumatic Grain Conveyor

**Application**: Moving grain vertically or horizontally.

**Principle**: Air stream carries grain through pipe.

**Components**:
- Blower or compressor
- Inlet hopper with airlock
- Pipe run
- Separator at outlet (cyclone)

**Advantage**: Flexible routing, enclosed (protects grain).

## Mechanical Power Storage

Storing mechanical energy for later use.

### Flywheels

Store kinetic energy in rotating mass.

**Energy Storage**:
```
Energy = ½ × I × ω²

Where:
I = Moment of inertia (higher at rim = more storage)
ω = Angular velocity (radians/second)
```

**Applications**:
- Smoothing engine power pulses
- Storing energy between reciprocating strokes
- Driving punch presses (energy accumulated, released in one punch)
- Maintaining momentum through dead centers

**Design**:
- **Solid disk**: Simple but inefficient (mass wasted near center)
- **Rim-loaded**: Most mass at rim maximizes storage for weight
- **Spoked**: Traditional design, rim for storage, spokes for support

**Material**: Cast iron traditional. Steel for higher speeds.

**Safety**: Flywheels store dangerous energy. If oversped or flawed, they explode. Guard all flywheels. Never exceed design speed.

### Clockwork (Springs)

Store energy in wound springs.

**Applications**:
- Clocks and watches
- Music boxes
- Mechanical timers
- Some small power tools

**Mainspring**: Coiled strip spring, wound up, releases energy through gear train.

**Escapement**: Controls rate of energy release, keeping time.

**Post-Collapse Relevance**: Clockwork mechanisms provide controlled power for small devices. Timers for automated systems.

### Counterweights and Gravitational Storage

Store energy by raising mass.

**Energy Storage**:
```
Energy = m × g × h

Where:
m = mass
g = gravitational acceleration
h = height raised
```

**Applications**:
- Clock weights (grandfather clocks)
- Counterbalanced windows and doors
- Cable lifts
- Pumped water storage (raise water when power available, release through turbine when needed)

**Advantages**:
- Simple
- No degradation (unlike batteries or springs)
- Scalable

**Pumped Hydro**: Largest form of energy storage. Pump water uphill when excess power available, run through turbine when power needed. Community-scale possibility.

### Compressed Air Storage

Air compressed into tanks stores energy.

**Energy Storage**: Depends on pressure, volume, and how expansion is managed.

**Applications**:
- Pneumatic tools (use when compressor off)
- Starting engines
- Emergency power

**Efficiency**: Moderate (50-70%). Heat lost in compression, cold during expansion.

**Large Scale**: Underground caverns used for utility-scale compressed air storage.

## Failure Modes and Troubleshooting

Understanding how mechanical systems fail helps prevent failure and diagnose problems.

### Gear Failures

**Tooth Breakage**:
- Cause: Overload, fatigue, manufacturing defect
- Signs: Sudden noise, loss of drive, visible broken tooth
- Prevention: Adequate sizing, proper material, avoid shock loads

**Pitting**:
- Cause: Surface fatigue from repeated contact stress
- Signs: Small craters on tooth surface, progressive
- Prevention: Adequate hardness, proper lubrication, reduce overload

**Scoring/Scuffing**:
- Cause: Lubrication failure, metal-to-metal contact
- Signs: Lines/grooves on tooth faces
- Prevention: Adequate lubrication, proper viscosity, run-in period

**Wear**:
- Cause: Abrasion, inadequate lubrication
- Signs: Thinned teeth, increased backlash
- Prevention: Clean lubrication, proper oil changes, filter

### Bearing Failures

**Seizure**:
- Cause: Lubrication failure
- Signs: Sudden lockup, heat damage, welded surfaces
- Prevention: Maintain lubrication, don't overload

**Brinelling**:
- Cause: Overload or impact while stationary
- Signs: Indentations in races, vibration at specific frequencies
- Prevention: Avoid impact loads, don't exceed load ratings

**Spalling**:
- Cause: Fatigue, contamination
- Signs: Flaking of race surfaces, rough operation
- Prevention: Keep clean, don't exceed design life

**Fretting**:
- Cause: Microscopic motion between parts (loose fit)
- Signs: Rust-colored debris, worn spots
- Prevention: Proper fits, no slip under load

### Shaft Failures

**Fatigue Fracture**:
- Cause: Cyclic loading, stress concentrations
- Signs: Beach marks on fracture surface (progressive growth)
- Prevention: Adequate sizing, smooth transitions, no sharp corners

**Yielding/Bending**:
- Cause: Overload
- Signs: Permanent bend in shaft
- Prevention: Don't exceed design loads

**Torsional Failure**:
- Cause: Excessive torque
- Signs: Twisted shaft, 45° fracture plane
- Prevention: Adequate sizing for torque

### Coupling and Alignment Problems

**Vibration**:
- Cause: Misalignment, imbalance
- Signs: Excessive noise, vibration at 1× or 2× running speed
- Prevention: Careful alignment, balance rotating parts

**Coupling Wear**:
- Cause: Misalignment, fatigue
- Signs: Worn elastomers, loose connections
- Prevention: Align properly, inspect regularly

### Troubleshooting Approach

1. **Observe**: What are the symptoms? Noise, vibration, heat, loss of function?

2. **When did it start?**: After a change? Gradually? Suddenly?

3. **Inspect without disassembly**: Look for obvious problems (loose bolts, leaks, broken parts).

4. **Check basics**:
   - Lubrication: Is oil level correct? When was it last changed?
   - Alignment: Any recent changes?
   - Overload: Operating within design limits?

5. **Disassemble if needed**: Inspect wear patterns, look for root cause.

6. **Fix root cause, not just symptom**: A replaced bearing fails again if the cause (misalignment, contamination) isn't addressed.

---

## Design Guidelines

### General Principles

**Simplicity**: Simpler mechanisms have fewer failure modes. Prefer simple solutions.

**Robustness**: Design for real-world conditions—dirt, shock, operator error. Add margin.

**Maintainability**: Design for easy access to wear parts. Someone will need to service this.

**Standardization**: Use standard sizes for bearings, fasteners, and materials. Enables spare parts.

**Safety**: Add guards. Design for failure to safe state. Consider what happens when things break.

### Safety Factors

Typical design safety factors:

| Application | Safety Factor |
|-------------|---------------|
| Static loads, known well | 2-3 |
| Static loads, less certain | 3-4 |
| Repeated loads (fatigue) | 4-6 |
| Shock loads | 6-10 |
| Human safety critical | 8-15 |

**Formula**: Allowable Stress = Ultimate Strength / Safety Factor

**Post-Collapse Reality**: Err on the side of larger safety factors. Materials may be variable. Loads may be unknown. Overbuilt and working beats optimized and broken.

### Manufacturing Considerations

**Design for available processes**: If you can only cast and file, design for casting and filing. Don't design parts requiring grinding if you can't grind.

**Minimize precision requirements**: Every precision surface costs time and effort. Use precision only where function demands.

**Standard materials**: Design for materials you can get. Steel is usually available. Specialty alloys may not be.

**Interchangeability**: Design so worn parts can be replaced without custom fitting. Requires standardized tolerances and manufacturing quality.

## Conclusion

Mechanical systems are the hidden foundation of industrial civilization. A gear train transmits the power from your water wheel to your mill. Bearings allow that transmission without friction consuming all your energy. Linkages convert the motion you have to the motion you need. Seals keep your hydraulic press working.

This knowledge was so ubiquitous pre-collapse that it was taken for granted. Every factory had mechanics who understood these principles. Every engineering school taught them. Now that knowledge must be consciously preserved and transmitted.

**Key Takeaways**:

1. **Power is conserved**: You can trade torque for speed, but not get something for nothing.

2. **Standardize early**: Gears and bearings from different sources must work together.

3. **Lubrication is critical**: The best mechanism fails without proper lubrication. See Chapter 2.8.

4. **Start simple**: Master spur gears before attempting helical. Master plain bearings before rolling. Complexity comes with competence.

5. **Safety margins matter**: Material quality varies. Loads are uncertain. Overbuild.

6. **Maintenance enables function**: Mechanisms need regular attention. Schedule it.

7. **Salvage wisely**: Ball bearings, precision gears, and hydraulic components are hard to manufacture. Salvage and preserve them.

The mechanisms in this chapter are the building blocks for everything else—from clocks to steam engines to automobiles. Master them, and you can build almost anything. Neglect them, and the most ambitious plans fail for want of a working bearing.
