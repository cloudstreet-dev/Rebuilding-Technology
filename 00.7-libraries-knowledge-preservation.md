# Chapter 0.7: Libraries and Knowledge Preservation

## THIS IS NOT OPTIONAL

Listen carefully: This guide is worthless if there's only one copy. Everything in these pages - water purification, agriculture, metallurgy, electricity - becomes meaningless if it burns, floods, or rots away. You can rebuild a water pump. You cannot rebuild lost knowledge.

Knowledge preservation is not a luxury for later. It is Tier 0. It is immediate. It is as critical as clean water and food. Without it, you are condemning your children to start from zero.

This chapter will save civilization. Read it. Follow it. Now.

---

## 1. WHY THIS IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL

### Knowledge Dies Without Preservation

You are standing on the edge of a knowledge cliff. Pre-collapse humanity knew how to build computers, synthesize medicines, generate electricity, purify water, grow food efficiently. Right now, some of that knowledge exists in books, in hard drives, in the minds of survivors.

In five years, the books will be moldy. In ten years, the hard drives will be dead. In twenty years, the survivors who remember will be gone. And if you did nothing, your grandchildren will be trying to reinvent the wheel while staring at rotted, unreadable books.

### This Guide Is Useless If It's the Only Copy

Right now, you are reading this guide. Perhaps it's printed. Perhaps it's on a screen. Here is the brutal truth: if this is the only copy and your settlement burns down, floods, or gets overrun, everything in these pages vanishes.

One book is zero books. One copy is no copies. Redundancy is everything.

### Books Decay Faster Than You Think

Paper seems permanent. It is not.

- **Mold**: Can consume a book in months in damp conditions
- **Insects**: Silverfish, bookworms, termites - they eat paper and glue
- **Light**: UV radiation breaks down paper fibers and fades ink
- **Acid**: Modern paper (post-1850s) contains acid that makes it self-destruct over decades
- **Fire**: Obvious but devastating
- **Water**: Destroys books almost as fast as fire
- **Rodents**: Will shred books for nesting material

A book improperly stored in a post-collapse environment might last 5-10 years before becoming unreadable. Properly stored, books can last centuries. The difference is knowledge preservation protocols.

### Redundancy Is Everything

The ancient Library of Alexandria burned. Thousands of years of accumulated knowledge vanished. Why? Single point of failure.

Medieval monks created multiple copies of texts and distributed them across monasteries. When Vikings burned one monastery, the knowledge survived in others.

You must think like a medieval monk, not like Alexandria. Multiple copies. Multiple locations. Always.

## 2. IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (YEAR 0-1)

These actions must happen in the first year. Not year two. Not "when we have time." Year zero or year one. Period.

### Action 1: Salvage All Books From Ruins

**Priority: CRITICAL**

If you are in or near a collapsed city, you are sitting on a treasure trove. Libraries, bookstores, universities, schools, homes - all contain books. Many are burning, rotting, or being destroyed right now.

**Target priority:**

1. **Technical manuals**: Engineering, agriculture, medicine, chemistry, physics, metallurgy, electricity, construction, water treatment
2. **This guide**: If you find another copy of this guide anywhere, secure it immediately
3. **Reference works**: Encyclopedias, dictionaries, textbooks
4. **Medical texts**: Diagnostic manuals, pharmacology, surgery, first aid
5. **Scientific texts**: Chemistry, biology, physics, mathematics
6. **Agricultural texts**: Crop growing, animal husbandry, soil management, seed saving
7. **Trade manuals**: Blacksmithing, carpentry, masonry, plumbing, electrical work
8. **Historical texts**: To understand what worked and what failed
9. **Cultural texts**: Literature, philosophy, history (lower priority but still valuable)

**Do not ignore "outdated" books.** A 1940s carpentry manual is more useful than no manual. A 1960s electronics textbook can teach fundamental principles even if the specific components are obsolete.

### Action 2: Create Climate-Controlled Storage Immediately

**Within first month:**

You need a dedicated book storage area. Not "a corner of a room." A dedicated space with controlled conditions.

**Requirements:**
- **Cool**: 60-70°F (15-21°C) if possible
- **Dry**: 30-50% relative humidity
- **Dark**: No windows, or windows completely blacked out
- **Sealed**: Protected from pests and weather
- **Elevated**: Never ground floor if flooding is possible
- **Ventilated**: Air circulation prevents mold, but avoid drafts that carry moisture or pests

**Temporary solutions if you cannot achieve ideal conditions:**
- Underground root cellar (cool, stable temperature, but watch humidity)
- Interior room with no exterior walls (more stable temperature)
- Sealed containers with desiccants (calcium chloride, silica gel, or even rice in extreme cases)

**DO NOT store books:**
- In basements (flooding risk, high humidity)
- In attics (temperature extremes, leaks)
- Against exterior walls (temperature fluctuations, moisture)
- Near kitchens (grease, smoke, humidity, pests)
- Where sunlight reaches them (UV damage)

### Action 3: Inventory What You Have

**Within first three months:**

You must know what you have. Create a catalog. Start simple:

**Minimum information per book:**
1. Title
2. Author
3. Subject category
4. Physical location
5. Condition (good / damaged / needs repair)
6. Number of copies you have

**Why this matters:** When fire threatens, you need to know which books to save first. When another community asks "do you have anything on metalworking?" you need to answer immediately. When planning copying, you need to know what gaps exist.

**Catalog format:** Written ledger, kept separately from the library. If the library burns, the catalog tells you what you lost and what you need to salvage or copy from other communities.

### Action 4: Prioritize Critical Texts

**Immediate tier (copy within Year 1):**

1. **This guide** (if you're reading it, copy it NOW)
2. Medical diagnostics and treatment
3. Water purification
4. Basic agriculture
5. Food preservation
6. Sanitation and hygiene
7. Basic chemistry
8. Basic metallurgy

**Why immediate:** These keep people alive. Everything else depends on survival.

### Action 5: Multiple Copies in Multiple Locations

**Rule:** Every critical text must have at least three copies in at least two separate locations.

**Example:**
- Copy 1: Main library (preservation quality, climate controlled, minimal handling)
- Copy 2: Working copy (can be used, loaned, worn out, then replaced)
- Copy 3: Different community or settlement, 10+ miles away

**Why:** Fire, flood, raid, disease, collapse. Any single location can be destroyed. Geographical distribution means knowledge survives local disasters.

---

## 3. BOOK PRESERVATION: THE SCIENCE

Books are organic materials. They decay. But decay can be slowed dramatically with proper conditions.

### Temperature: 60-70°F Ideal

**Why:** Chemical reactions (including decay) slow at lower temperatures. Every 10°F decrease roughly doubles the lifespan of paper.

**Practical reality:** You may not have refrigeration. Do your best:
- Stable temperature is more important than perfect temperature
- Avoid temperature swings (day/night, seasonal)
- Underground storage provides stable temperatures naturally
- Insulation helps

**Warning:** Freezing is fine for preservation (libraries use it for pest control) but freeze/thaw cycles damage books through moisture condensation.

### Humidity: 30-50% Ideal

**Why:**
- Too high (>60%): Mold grows, paper swells, adhesives fail, insects thrive
- Too low (<30%): Paper becomes brittle, ink cracks, leather binding fails

**Measurement:** If you don't have a hygrometer, use signs:
- Too humid: Books feel damp, pages stick, musty smell, visible mold
- Too dry: Pages crackle, paper cracks at folds, leather binding flakes

**Control methods:**
- **Reduce humidity**: Ventilation, desiccants (calcium chloride, silica gel), sun-dried air
- **Increase humidity**: Sealed containers with small water source, damp clay pots
- **Stability**: More important than perfection. Fluctuating humidity is more damaging than steady humidity outside ideal range.

### Light: Darkness

**Why:** Light (especially UV) breaks down cellulose fibers in paper and fades ink.

**Rules:**
- Natural light: NEVER. No windows or completely blacked out.
- Artificial light: Only when accessing books. Keep library dark otherwise.
- Reading: Take books to lit area, do not bring light to shelves.

**Evidence of light damage:** Faded covers, yellowed pages, brittle paper on exposed edges.

### Pests: The Enemy

**Common book-destroying pests:**

1. **Silverfish**: Eat paper, glue, sizing (starch). Thrive in damp conditions.
2. **Bookworms** (book lice, various beetle larvae): Bore through paper and binding. Tiny holes in pages are evidence.
3. **Termites**: Eat cellulose (paper). Devastating to entire libraries.
4. **Rodents**: Shred paper for nests, urine damages books, droppings carry mold spores.
5. **Cockroaches**: Eat glue and sizing, leave stains and odors.
6. **Mold and mildew**: Not pests but biological threats. Grow in high humidity, destroy paper, release spores.

**Prevention:**
- Clean storage area (no food, organic debris)
- Sealed room (no gaps for entry)
- Low humidity (most pests need moisture)
- Air circulation (discourages mold)
- Regular inspection (catch infestations early)
- Cleanliness (dust attracts pests)

**Treatment if infestation occurs:**
- Remove infested books immediately (prevent spread)
- Freezing kills insects (if you have freezer): 0°F for 3+ days
- Sun and heat kill insects: 120°F+ for several hours (risks damaging books)
- Quarantine: Treat/inspect before returning to library
- DO NOT USE PESTICIDES directly on books (poisons and damages paper)

### Storage: Shelves Not Floor, Away From Walls

**Proper shelving:**
- Shelves, not floor (protects from flooding, pests, moisture)
- Away from exterior walls (temperature and moisture fluctuations)
- Vertical storage (books upright, supported by bookends)
- Not too tight (air circulation, easy removal)
- Not too loose (books lean and warp)

**Large books:** Lay flat. Standing upright stresses spine.

**Very fragile books:** Individual boxes or wrapping (acid-free paper if available, clean cotton cloth if not).

### Handling: Clean Hands, No Food/Drink Near Books

**Rules for everyone:**
- Wash hands before handling (oils and dirt damage paper and attract pests)
- No food or drink near books (spills destroy, crumbs attract pests)
- Support book spine when opening (don't break binding)
- Turn pages by top corner gently (oils from fingers damage paper)
- No licking fingers to turn pages (saliva degrades paper, introduces bacteria)
- Use bookmarks, never fold pages (creases become breaks)

**For valuable/fragile texts:**
- Handle only when necessary
- Use gloves if available (clean cotton, not latex/rubber which can trap moisture)
- Support with both hands
- Work on clean, padded surface

---

## 4. COPYING PROTOCOLS

You have books. Now you must copy them. This is not optional.

### Copy This Guide FIRST

**Priority one:** If you are reading this guide, and you have any means to copy it (printing, photocopying, even hand-copying), do it immediately.

**Why:** This guide is your roadmap to rebuilding everything. If this is the only copy and it's destroyed, you lose the accumulated knowledge of rebuilding water systems, agriculture, electricity, chemistry, metallurgy, and everything else.

**Target:** Three copies minimum. One preservation copy (never leaves controlled storage), one working copy (can be used daily), one copy in a different location (different community, or at minimum different building 1+ mile away).

**Method:** See Chapter 4.5 (Printing Technology) for creating a printing press. Until then, hand-copy or use salvaged printers/copiers if electricity available.

### Prioritization: Technical > Historical > Entertainment

**Copying takes time and resources.** You must prioritize.

**Tier 1 (Year 0-1): Survival**
- This guide
- Medical diagnostics and treatment
- Emergency medicine and first aid
- Water purification
- Basic agriculture and crop growing
- Food preservation
- Sanitation
- Basic construction
- Tool making

**Tier 2 (Year 1-3): Foundation Technology**
- Advanced agriculture (crop rotation, soil management, breeding)
- Metallurgy (smelting, forging, casting)
- Chemistry fundamentals
- Electricity generation and distribution
- Mathematics (algebra, geometry, trigonometry, calculus)
- Physics fundamentals
- Mechanical engineering
- Woodworking and carpentry

**Tier 3 (Year 3-10): Advanced Technology**
- Advanced chemistry (synthesis, pharmacology)
- Electronics and computing
- Advanced metallurgy (alloys, heat treatment)
- Advanced medicine (surgery, pharmacology)
- Engineering references (mechanical, civil, chemical, electrical)
- Advanced mathematics (differential equations, statistics)

**Tier 4 (Year 10+): Cultural Preservation**
- Literature and fiction
- History
- Philosophy
- Arts and music
- Languages
- Cultural texts

**Note:** Tier 4 is not unimportant. Culture is what makes us human. But in a triage situation, you copy survival knowledge first. No one alive to read Shakespeare? Shakespeare doesn't matter. Keep people alive first, preserve culture second.

### Quality Control: Verify Copies Against Original

**Every copy must be verified.**

**Method:**
1. Scribe/printer creates copy
2. Different person checks copy against original
3. Errors marked and corrected
4. Second verification
5. Only then is copy considered valid

**Why:** Copying errors compound. A copied error gets copied again, and again. After ten generations of copying, the text may be unrecognizable. Verification breaks this chain.

**Common copying errors:**
- Skipped lines or paragraphs
- Transposed numbers (37 becomes 73)
- Misspellings that change meaning (oxidation becomes oxidization)
- Omitted diagrams or illustrations
- Smudged or illegible text

**Standard:** One error per 100 pages is acceptable for working copies. Zero errors for preservation copies of critical texts.

### Scribes If Printing Not Available Yet

**Reality:** You may not have working printing press for years. Until then, hand-copying is the only option.

**Training scribes:**
- Clear, legible handwriting (printing, not cursive, for clarity)
- Attention to detail (every word, every number, every diagram)
- Patience (cannot rush)
- Ability to read and understand what they're copying (reduces errors)

**Scribe working conditions:**
- Good light (natural light best, but not direct sun on books)
- Comfortable position (copying is physically demanding)
- Scheduled breaks (fatigue causes errors)
- Quiet environment (concentration critical)

**Materials:**
- Ink: Carbon black (soot + oil/water), iron gall ink (oak galls + iron sulfate + gum arabic), or salvaged pens/ink
- Paper: Salvaged, or manufactured (see section on papermaking)
- Writing instruments: Salvaged pens, quills (goose feathers), brushes

### Create At Least 3 Copies of Critical Texts

**Rule:** Never fewer than three copies of anything critical.

**Reasoning:**
- Copy 1 (Preservation): Climate controlled storage, minimal handling, verified accuracy
- Copy 2 (Working): Daily use, can be marked up, loaned, worn out (then replaced from preservation copy)
- Copy 3 (Backup): Different location, insurance against local disaster

**For truly critical texts (this guide, medical references, water purification):** Aim for five to ten copies distributed across multiple communities.

### Distribute Geographically

**One disaster should not destroy all copies.**

**Minimum distribution:** Two separate buildings, 1+ mile apart.

**Better distribution:** Different communities, 10+ miles apart.

**Best distribution:** Network of communities, 50-100+ miles apart, each maintaining copies and sharing catalogs.

**Trade copies like gold:** Because they are gold. A community with medical texts should trade copies to communities without them. A community with agricultural texts should share with others. Knowledge shared is knowledge preserved.

---

## 5. INDEX SYSTEMS

You have books. You have copies. Now you must organize them so knowledge can be found.

A library without an index is a pile of books. An indexed library is a knowledge system.

### Catalog Every Book

**Minimum catalog entry:**
1. **Title**: Full title of book
2. **Author**: If known
3. **Subject**: Primary category (Medicine, Agriculture, Chemistry, etc.)
4. **Location**: Where physically stored (Shelf A, Box 3, Building 2, etc.)
5. **Copies**: How many copies exist, where each is located
6. **Condition**: Good / Fair / Poor / Damaged
7. **Notes**: Special information (diagrams, specific topics, missing pages, etc.)

**Example entry:**
```
Title: Emergency Medicine Field Guide
Author: Dr. Sarah Chen
Subject: Medicine - Emergency
Location: Main Library, Shelf B-3
Copies: 3 (Main Library, East Settlement, Working Copy)
Condition: Good
Notes: Contains surgical procedures, trauma treatment, common medications
```

### Subject Classification

**You need a system to categorize books by subject.**

**Option 1: Simplified Dewey Decimal**

If you understand the Dewey Decimal system, use it. It's proven and works.

**Option 2: Simple Category System**

If Dewey is too complex, create a simple system:

- **000-099: Reference** (encyclopedias, dictionaries, catalogs, this guide)
- **100-199: Medicine** (diagnostics, treatment, surgery, first aid, pharmacology)
- **200-299: Agriculture** (crops, animals, soil, seeds, forestry, fishing)
- **300-399: Chemistry** (fundamentals, synthesis, materials, metallurgy)
- **400-499: Physics & Mathematics** (mechanics, electricity, math, measurement)
- **500-599: Engineering** (mechanical, civil, electrical, construction)
- **600-699: Trades** (carpentry, masonry, blacksmithing, plumbing, textiles)
- **700-799: Technology** (printing, papermaking, glassmaking, pottery, tools)
- **800-899: History & Culture** (history, literature, philosophy, arts)
- **900-999: Practical Skills** (cooking, preservation, hunting, fishing, survival)

**Subdivide as needed.** For example, 100-199 Medicine could be:
- 100-109: Medical reference and diagnostics
- 110-119: Emergency medicine and trauma
- 120-129: Surgery
- 130-139: Pharmacology and medicines
- 140-149: Disease and infection
- 150-159: Anatomy and physiology
- And so on...

**Write your classification system down** and keep it with the catalog. Anyone using the library must understand the system.

### Cross-Referencing

**Books cover multiple subjects.** A book on blacksmithing might be relevant to metallurgy, tool-making, and construction.

**Solution:** Cross-reference entries.

**Example:**
```
Title: The Complete Blacksmith
Primary Subject: 640 - Trades - Blacksmithing
Cross-References: 330 - Metallurgy; 720 - Tool Making; 510 - Construction
```

**Index cards or ledger pages:** One card per book, filed under primary subject. Note cross-references so users know to check other categories.

### Finding Aids

**Create guides for common questions:**

**"I need to know how to..."**
- Purify water → Reference 000, Water Section
- Treat infection → Medicine 140-149
- Grow wheat → Agriculture 210-219
- Generate electricity → Physics 430-439
- Make soap → Practical Skills 920-929

**"I need books on..."**
- Medicine → 100-199
- Farming → 200-299
- Chemistry → 300-399

**These finding aids should be posted visibly in library** and included in catalog.

### Keep Catalog Separate From Library

**Critical:** The catalog tells you what you have. If fire destroys the library and catalog together, you don't even know what you lost.

**Solution:**
- Master catalog: Kept in separate building from library
- Working catalog: Copy kept in library for daily use
- Backup catalog: Copy kept in different community/location

**Update all three when changes made.**

---

## 6. TRAINING LIBRARIANS

Librarian is not a job. It is a critical profession. Librarians are the guardians of knowledge. Without them, libraries fail.

### Why Librarians Are Critical

**A library without a librarian is:**
- Disorganized (no one can find anything)
- Decaying (no one monitoring conditions)
- Shrinking (no copying, no acquisition)
- Dying (no one teaching next generation)

**A library with a librarian is:**
- Organized (knowledge accessible)
- Preserved (conditions maintained, damage prevented)
- Growing (copying, trading, acquiring)
- Immortal (knowledge passed down)

### Skills Required

**1. Preservation**
- Understanding of temperature, humidity, light, pests
- Monitoring conditions daily
- Identifying and addressing damage early
- Repair and restoration techniques

**2. Cataloging**
- Creating and maintaining catalog
- Subject classification
- Cross-referencing
- Updating records

**3. Copying**
- Organizing copying projects
- Quality control and verification
- Managing scribes or printing operations
- Prioritizing what to copy

**4. Teaching**
- Helping users find information
- Teaching use of catalog and finding aids
- Training apprentice librarians
- Teaching scribes

**5. Acquisition**
- Trading with other communities for copies
- Salvaging books from ruins (if still possible)
- Identifying gaps in collection
- Negotiating exchanges

**6. Knowledge of Contents**
- Librarian must know what the library contains
- Must be able to say "We have three books on water purification, two on well digging, one on pump construction"
- Must understand subject matter enough to guide users
- Does not need to be expert in everything, but must know what's available

### Succession: Train Apprentices

**A librarian will die.** Knowledge of library operations must not die with them.

**Solution:** Every librarian must have at least one apprentice, trained over years.

**Apprentice training (3-5 years minimum):**
- Year 1: Basic preservation, cataloging, organization
- Year 2: Copying, quality control, repair techniques
- Year 3: Advanced preservation, teaching users, acquisition
- Year 4-5: Managing library independently under supervision

**When librarian ages or becomes unable to continue, apprentice becomes librarian and begins training new apprentice.**

**Never fewer than two people who know how to run the library.**

---

## 7. TRAINING SCRIBES (UNTIL PRINTING AVAILABLE)

Until you have working printing press (see Chapter 4.5), hand-copying is the only way to duplicate texts.

Scribes are critical profession in interim period.

### Careful Handwriting

**Legibility is everything.** Beautiful handwriting is nice. Legible handwriting is essential.

**Standards:**
- Print, not cursive (cursive is harder to read, especially across generations/regions)
- Consistent letter formation
- Adequate spacing between words and lines
- Clear distinction between similar characters (l/I, 0/O, 5/S, etc.)
- Dark ink (faded ink becomes unreadable)

**Training:** Practice copying simple texts repeatedly until handwriting is consistent and clear.

### Accuracy Verification (Two Scribes, Compare)

**Method 1: Two Scribes, Compare**
- Two scribes independently copy same text
- Compare copies to each other and to original
- Differences indicate error in one or both
- Consult original to determine correct version

**Method 2: Scribe and Checker**
- One scribe copies text
- Different person checks copy against original
- Errors marked for correction
- Scribe corrects, checker verifies corrections

**Method 2 is faster but slightly less reliable than Method 1.**

**For critical texts (this guide, medical texts, chemistry formulas):** Use Method 1. Accuracy is more important than speed.

### Materials

**Ink:**

**Option 1: Carbon black ink** (simplest)
- Carbon black (soot from oil lamp or wood fire, very fine)
- Binder (gum arabic, egg white, or hide glue)
- Water
- Mix to consistency slightly thicker than water

**Option 2: Iron gall ink** (more permanent, traditional manuscript ink)
- Oak galls (growth on oak trees caused by wasp larvae)
- Iron sulfate (ferrous sulfate, copperas) - can be made from iron and sulfuric acid
- Gum arabic
- Water
- Recipe: Crush galls, soak in water 1-3 days, add iron sulfate, add gum arabic

**Option 3: Salvaged pens and ink**
- Ballpoint pens, felt-tip markers, fountain pens, bottled ink
- Use while available, but don't depend on them (finite supply)

**Paper:**
- Salvaged paper (cleanest, smoothest available)
- Manufactured paper (see Chapter on papermaking if needed)
- Parchment (treated animal skin, labor-intensive but extremely durable)

**Writing instruments:**
- Salvaged pens (ballpoint, felt-tip, fountain)
- Quills (goose, turkey, crow feathers - sharpen tip at angle)
- Reed pens (hollow reed cut at angle)
- Brushes (for ink)

### Pace: 3-5 Pages Per Day for Careful Copying

**Reality check:** Accurate hand-copying is slow.

**Average pace:**
- Simple text, experienced scribe: 5-8 pages per day
- Complex text (diagrams, tables, formulas): 2-4 pages per day
- Inexperienced scribe: 1-3 pages per day
- Verification: 10-15 pages per day (reading and comparing)

**A 300-page book takes:**
- Experienced scribe: 2-3 months of work
- Inexperienced scribe: 3-6 months
- With verification: Add 50% to time

**This is why printing press is critical** (Chapter 4.5). Once you have printing, copying speed increases 10-100x.

**But until then, scribes are your only option.** Plan accordingly. Start copying immediately. Every day delayed is another day of knowledge vulnerability.

---

## 8. DISTRIBUTED BACKUP

If all copies are in one location, you have zero copies when that location burns.

### Never One Library

**Minimum:** Two separate libraries, different buildings, 1+ mile apart.

**Better:** Three separate libraries, different settlements, 10+ miles apart.

**Best:** Network of libraries across multiple communities, 50-100+ miles apart.

**Why distance matters:** Fire spreads. Flood zones are regional. Raiders target concentrated resources. Disease can wipe out single community. Distance makes simultaneous destruction less likely.

### Multiple Communities Maintain Copies

**Model:** Monastic network of medieval Europe.

Monasteries across Europe each maintained copies of texts. When Vikings burned one monastery, knowledge survived in others. When plague struck one region, others preserved and could restore lost texts.

**Your network should work the same way:**
- Each community maintains library
- Each library has some unique texts and many shared texts
- Catalogs are shared between communities
- When Community A has unique text, they copy it and send copies to Communities B and C
- When disaster strikes one community, others can help rebuild their library

### Exchange Catalogs

**Critical:** Communities must know what each other has.

**Process:**
1. Each community creates catalog (see Section 5)
2. Catalogs copied and shared with allied communities
3. Update shared catalogs annually or when major acquisitions made
4. When Community A needs text they don't have, they check catalogs from B, C, D to see who has it

**Example exchange:**
- Community A has extensive medical library but little on metallurgy
- Community B has extensive metallurgy library but little on medicine
- They consult each other's catalogs, identify gaps
- Community A copies medical texts for B; Community B copies metallurgy texts for A
- Both communities now have both, knowledge is preserved in two locations

### Fill Gaps

**Every community will have gaps in knowledge.**

**Regular gap analysis:**
1. Review your catalog
2. Identify weak areas (few or no books on subject)
3. Consult catalogs from allied communities
4. Request copies of texts that fill your gaps
5. Provide copies of your texts that fill their gaps

**Trade value:** Knowledge is currency. A community that freely shares texts earns goodwill and receives texts in return.

### Trade Copies Like Gold (Because They Are Gold)

**Truth:** A book is worth more than gold.

Gold cannot teach you to purify water, grow food, or treat infection. A book can.

**When trading with other communities:**
- Copies of critical texts are high-value trade goods
- Offer copies in exchange for goods, services, or other copies
- Never refuse to trade knowledge for petty reasons (knowledge shared benefits everyone)

**However:** Protect originals. Only trade copies. If original is lost, preservation copy remains.

---

## 9. DIGITAL PRESERVATION (IF SALVAGED MEDIA AVAILABLE)

If you have access to hard drives, flash drives, CDs, DVDs with digital information, listen carefully:

**Digital storage is temporary. Paper is long-term.**

### Hard Drives Degrade (5-10 Years Unpowered)

**Reality:** Unpowered hard drives typically fail within 5-10 years.

**Why:**
- Magnetic domains randomize over time
- Mechanical components seize (lubricants dry out)
- Electronics corrode
- Seals fail (moisture enters)

**Action:** If you have hard drives with critical information, power them regularly (every 6-12 months) to refresh magnetic data. But this requires electricity. Post-collapse, electricity may not be reliable.

**Better action:** Print everything critical immediately.

### Flash Drives Better But Still Degrade

**Reality:** Flash drives (USB sticks, SD cards, SSDs) typically last 10-20 years unpowered, but degradation accelerates in poor conditions.

**Why:**
- Electron charge leaks from floating gates over time
- High temperatures accelerate decay
- Humidity causes corrosion

**Action:** Flash drives are more reliable than hard drives for unpowered storage, but still not permanent. Print critical information.

### Optical Media (CD/DVD) Last 10-50 Years If Stored Well

**Reality:** CDs and DVDs, if stored properly, can last 10-50+ years.

**Storage requirements:**
- Cool, stable temperature
- Low humidity
- Dark (light degrades dye layer)
- Vertical storage (not stacked flat)
- Proper cases (no scratches on surface)

**Advantages:**
- No power required to maintain data
- Relatively durable
- Can be read with salvaged computers/players

**Disadvantages:**
- Require working computer and power to read
- Scratches make unreadable
- Not editable (read-only)

**Action:** If you have critical data on CD/DVD, store carefully, but also print to paper.

### Print Digital Texts to Paper ASAP

**Rule:** If it's digital and critical, print it now.

**Why:**
- Digital media degrades
- Digital requires power and working computers to read
- Paper, properly stored, lasts centuries with no power

**Priority printing:**
1. This guide (if digital)
2. Medical references
3. Technical manuals
4. Agricultural texts
5. Chemistry and physics references
6. Mathematics texts
7. Engineering references
8. Everything else

**Method:**
- Salvaged printers (while they work and ink/toner available)
- Photocopiers (while they work)
- Screen-to-scribe (display on screen, scribe copies by hand)
- Create printing press (Chapter 4.5) for long-term printing capability

### Digital Is Temporary, Paper Is Long-Term

**Medieval manuscripts from 500-1000 AD are still readable.**

**Digital files from 1980s-1990s are mostly unreadable** (obsolete formats, degraded media, no compatible hardware/software).

**Lesson:** Paper, properly stored, outlasts digital by centuries.

**Use digital while you have it, but do not trust it for long-term preservation.**

---

## 10. KNOWLEDGE TRIAGE

You cannot copy everything immediately. You must prioritize.

### Tier 1: Survival (Copy NOW - Year 0-1)

**These keep people alive. Without these, nothing else matters.**

- This guide (Rebuilding Technology)
- Medical diagnostics and emergency treatment
- First aid and trauma care
- Water purification and well construction
- Basic agriculture (crop growing, timing, techniques)
- Food preservation (drying, salting, smoking, canning)
- Sanitation and waste management
- Basic construction (shelter, storage)
- Fire starting and management
- Basic tool making and maintenance

**Goal:** Three copies of each text, distributed across at least two locations, within first year.

### Tier 2: Foundation Tech (Copy Year 1-3)

**These enable rebuilding civilization.**

- Advanced agriculture (crop rotation, soil management, composting, breeding)
- Animal husbandry (raising livestock, breeding, care)
- Metallurgy fundamentals (ore identification, smelting, forging, casting)
- Basic chemistry (elements, compounds, reactions, acids/bases)
- Electricity generation (water, wind, basic generators)
- Mathematics (arithmetic through calculus)
- Physics fundamentals (mechanics, thermodynamics, optics, electricity)
- Mechanical engineering (machines, tools, mechanisms)
- Advanced construction (bridges, dams, mills)
- Woodworking and carpentry
- Textiles (spinning, weaving, dyeing)
- Pottery and ceramics
- Glassmaking

**Goal:** Two copies of each text, distributed across at least two locations, within three years.

### Tier 3: Advanced Tech (Copy Year 3-10)

**These enable advanced civilization.**

- Advanced chemistry (organic synthesis, pharmacology, materials science)
- Advanced metallurgy (alloys, heat treatment, specialized processes)
- Advanced medicine (surgery, specialized diagnostics, advanced pharmacology)
- Electronics (circuits, components, semiconductors)
- Computing (programming, algorithms, data structures)
- Advanced mathematics (differential equations, linear algebra, statistics, analysis)
- Chemical engineering
- Civil engineering
- Electrical engineering
- Advanced physics (electromagnetism, quantum mechanics, relativity)
- Telecommunications
- Optics and lens making

**Goal:** Two copies of each text within ten years.

### Tier 4: Cultural (Copy Year 10+)

**These make us human.**

- Literature and fiction
- History (general, regional, world)
- Philosophy
- Arts (visual, performing, music)
- Languages and linguistics
- Cultural and religious texts
- Biography
- Poetry

**Important:** This is not "unimportant." Culture matters. History matters. Literature matters. But in triage situation, survival comes first.

**Goal:** One copy of each text, ongoing project beyond year ten.

### All Tiers Matter But Survival Comes First

**If you copy Shakespeare before water purification texts, and people die of dysentery, you have failed.**

**If you copy nothing cultural and in 50 years your community is technically advanced but culturally dead, you have also failed.**

**Balance:** Prioritize survival and foundation, but do not abandon culture entirely. Allocate copying resources proportionally:

- Year 1: 100% Tier 1
- Year 2-3: 80% Tier 1-2, 20% Tier 3
- Year 4-10: 50% Tier 2-3, 30% Tier 1 (expanding coverage), 20% Tier 4
- Year 10+: 40% Tier 3, 30% expanding all tiers, 30% Tier 4

## 11. RESTORATION TECHNIQUES

Books get damaged. If you can repair them, you save knowledge.

### Repairing Torn Pages

**Materials needed:**
- Thin paper (similar weight to damaged page if possible)
- Wheat paste or rice paste (flour + water, cooked to paste consistency)
- Brush (small, soft)
- Clean flat surface
- Weight (books or flat stones)

**Process:**
1. Clean edges of tear (remove dust/dirt)
2. Align torn pieces exactly
3. Cut repair paper into thin strip
4. Apply paste to repair strip (thin layer)
5. Place strip over tear on back side of page
6. Press gently, work out air bubbles
7. Place wax paper over repair
8. Weight and dry 24+ hours

**Tip:** For large tears, repair both sides with separate strips.

### Deacidification (Baking Soda Solution for Acidic Paper)

**Problem:** Modern paper (post-1850s) contains acid from manufacturing. Acid breaks down cellulose, making paper brittle and yellowed.

**Solution:** Deacidification neutralizes acid.

**Simple method:**
- Baking soda (sodium bicarbonate)
- Water
- Shallow tray
- Blotting paper or clean cloth

**Process:**
1. Mix solution: 1 tablespoon baking soda per quart water
2. Test on one page first (check for ink running)
3. If safe, remove page from book
4. Submerge page in solution 5-10 minutes
5. Remove and blot gently (do not rub)
6. Lay flat to dry on clean surface
7. Weight lightly to prevent curling

**Warning:** This method only works if ink is water-resistant. Some inks (iron gall, modern ballpoint) are safe. Others (some fountain pen inks, markers) will run. Always test first.

**Alternative for books that can't be disassembled:** Commercial deacidification sprays exist (magnesium oxide, etc.) but may not be available post-collapse.

### Rebinding Damaged Books

**When binding fails:**
- Pages loose
- Cover detached
- Spine broken

**Simple rebinding:**

**Materials:**
- Thread (linen, cotton, or dental floss if needed)
- Needle
- Awl or sharp tool (for punching holes)
- Cardboard or thin wood (for covers)
- Cloth or leather (for spine covering)
- Glue (wheat paste, hide glue, or modern glue if available)

**Process:**
1. Remove old binding materials carefully
2. Organize pages in correct order
3. Punch holes along spine edge (3-5 holes for standard book)
4. Sew pages together through holes (simple running stitch or more complex if skilled)
5. Create new covers (cardboard cut to size)
6. Attach pages to covers (glue endpapers to inside covers)
7. Cover spine with cloth/leather (glued, protects and reinforces)

**Complex rebinding:** Traditional bookbinding is skilled craft. If someone in your community has bookbinding skills, prioritize learning from them.

### Mold Removal (Carefully)

**Prevention is better than cure.** Mold damages paper permanently. But if mold occurs:

**Process:**
1. Isolate moldy books immediately (prevent spreading spores)
2. Take outside (spores should not be released indoors)
3. Brush off surface mold gently with soft brush (wear mask, mold spores are harmful)
4. Wipe pages with cloth barely dampened with alcohol (if available) or dilute vinegar (kills mold)
5. Dry thoroughly (sun and air, but not too hot)
6. Check for return of mold (if reappears, repeat)

**Severe mold:** If mold has penetrated deep into paper or caused structural damage, book may be unsalvageable. Copy contents before it worsens.

**Prevention:** Control humidity, ventilation, keep library clean.

## 12. LONG-TERM STORAGE

You've salvaged books, copied them, cataloged them. Now preserve them for generations.

### Climate Control (See Section 3)

**Repeat because critical:**
- Temperature: 60-70°F, stable
- Humidity: 30-50%, stable
- Light: Dark
- Pests: None
- Air: Circulation, but not drafts

**Monitor daily.** Small problems (slightly high humidity) become large problems (mold outbreak) if ignored.

### Fire Suppression

**Fire is the greatest threat to libraries.** Water is second.

**Prevention:**
- No open flames in library (ever)
- No heat sources near books
- Lightning protection if possible
- Fire breaks between library and other buildings

**Suppression:**
- Water damages books almost as badly as fire
- Sand or dirt can smother fire with less damage than water
- Remove books from burning building if safe
- If fire is uncontrollable and you must choose what to save, go to preservation copies first (see prioritization lists)

**Extreme measure:** If fire threatens and cannot be stopped, bury books in dry location marked clearly. Recover after fire passes. Books may be dirty but recoverable. Better than ashes.

### Flood Protection

**Water destroys books.**

**Prevention:**
- Never basements or low-lying areas
- Elevated locations
- Away from rivers/streams
- Consider historical flood zones
- Drainage around building

**Response if flooding occurs:**
- Elevate books immediately
- Remove from water as fast as possible
- Air dry (open books, fan pages, dry air circulation)
- Freezing books stops damage temporarily (if freezer available) until you can dry them
- Mold will grow on wet books within 48 hours - dry fast

### Security

**Books are treasure.** They will be stolen if not protected.

**Security measures:**
- Controlled access (locked when unattended)
- Inventory regularly (detect theft)
- Community understanding that library is shared resource (thieves face social consequences)
- Backup copies elsewhere (theft of one copy doesn't destroy knowledge)

**But balance security with access:** A library no one can use is worthless. Find balance between protection and accessibility.

## 13. ACCESS VS. PRESERVATION

You face a dilemma:

**Use damages books.** Handling, opening, page-turning, exposure to light and air and oils from hands - all cause wear.

**Non-use wastes books.** A book no one reads is knowledge no one has.

How do you resolve this?

### Dilemma: Use Damages, Non-Use Wastes

**If you let everyone handle books freely:**
- Books wear out faster
- Pages torn, bindings broken
- Spills, stains, damage
- In 10 years, books are ruined

**If you lock books away and allow no access:**
- Knowledge stays pristine
- But no one learns
- No benefit to anyone
- Knowledge unused is knowledge lost

**Both extremes fail.**

### Solution: Working Copies vs. Preservation Copies

**The solution used by libraries for centuries:**

**Preservation Copy (Master Copy):**
- Highest quality
- Verified accurate
- Climate controlled storage
- Minimal handling
- Never leaves controlled environment
- Used only to create new copies when working copies wear out

**Working Copy (Circulating Copy):**
- Can be used daily
- Can be loaned to users
- Can be marked up (notes, bookmarks - but never destroyed)
- Wear is expected
- When worn out, replaced from preservation copy

**How many of each:**
- Preservation: 1-2 copies (one local, one distant backup)
- Working: 2+ copies (depends on demand)

**Example:**
- "Rebuilding Technology" (this guide) has:
  - 2 preservation copies (main library climate controlled, allied community 50 miles away)
  - 5 working copies (3 in main community for daily use, 2 in allied settlements)

**As working copies wear out:** Create new working copies from preservation copy. Preservation copy remains intact.

### Preservation Copy: Never Leaves Controlled Environment

**Rules for preservation copy:**
- Stored in climate-controlled area
- Handled only by librarian or trained person
- Removed only for copying or in emergency evacuation
- Never loaned
- Never taken outside controlled storage

**Purpose:** Insurance. No matter what happens to working copies, preservation copy allows recovery.

### Working Copies: Can Be Loaned, Used, Worn Out (Then Replaced)

**Rules for working copies:**
- Can be borrowed (with return expectation)
- Can be used in field (someone needs medical text during emergency)
- Can be marked up (pencil notes acceptable if useful - but not destructive)
- Expected to wear out over years

**When working copy becomes too damaged:**
- If still legible, downgrade to "study copy" (used only in supervised setting)
- If illegible, create new working copy from preservation copy
- Dispose of truly ruined copy (no value)

**Balance:** Working copies enable access. Preservation copies enable continuity.

## 14. COMMON MISTAKES THAT KILL LIBRARIES

Learn from failures:

### Mistake 1: Damp Storage (Mold)

**Scenario:** Books stored in basement or poorly ventilated room. Humidity rises. Within months, mold appears. Within a year, books are unreadable, contaminated.

**Prevention:** Dry storage, humidity control, ventilation, regular inspection.

### Mistake 2: Bright Light (Fading)

**Scenario:** Books stored near windows or in well-lit room. Over years, covers fade, pages yellow and become brittle, ink fades. Information lost.

**Prevention:** Dark storage, no windows, light only during access.

### Mistake 3: Single Location (Fire Destroys All)

**Scenario:** All copies in one building. Fire, flood, raid, or collapse destroys building. All knowledge lost.

**Prevention:** Multiple copies, distributed geographically, no single point of failure.

### Mistake 4: No Inventory (Don't Know What You Lost)

**Scenario:** No catalog maintained. Disaster strikes. Survivors don't know what was lost, what to seek from other communities, what gaps to fill.

**Prevention:** Catalog maintained, updated, stored separately from library.

### Mistake 5: No Copying (Only One Copy Exists)

**Scenario:** "We have the book, that's enough." Book damaged or destroyed. No backup. Knowledge lost.

**Prevention:** Copy critical texts immediately. Minimum three copies. Never only one.

### Mistake 6: Ignoring Pests (Insects Destroy Books)

**Scenario:** Small pest problem ignored. "Just a few bugs." Population explodes. Books riddled with holes, eaten, destroyed.

**Prevention:** Regular inspection, immediate action on pest signs, clean storage, humidity control.

### Mistake 7: Poor Handling (Books Fall Apart)

**Scenario:** No handling rules. Users eat while reading, crack spines, fold pages, handle with dirty hands. Books deteriorate rapidly.

**Prevention:** Handling rules, education, working vs. preservation copies.

### Mistake 8: Deprioritizing Copying (Always Later, Never Now)

**Scenario:** "We'll copy that next year." Next year: "Maybe the year after." Years pass. Original degrades or is lost. Never copied.

**Prevention:** Copying schedule, prioritization, dedicated scribes or printing operation, urgency mindset.

## 15. SUCCESS METRICS

How do you know if you're succeeding at knowledge preservation?

### Year 5: At Least 3 Copies of This Guide in Different Locations

**Metric:** This guide (Rebuilding Technology) exists in at least three copies, stored in at least two different locations separated by 1+ mile.

**Why:** This guide is your foundation. If this is lost, everything else becomes harder. Three copies, distributed, means local disaster doesn't destroy it.

**Check:** Can you point to three physical copies right now? Are they in different locations? If not, copy it immediately.

### Year 10: Comprehensive Catalog Maintained, Major Texts Copied

**Metrics:**
- Complete catalog of all books exists
- Catalog is updated and accurate
- All Tier 1 texts (survival) have minimum 3 copies
- All Tier 2 texts (foundation) have minimum 2 copies
- Copying operation is ongoing (scribes or printing press functional)

**Why:** By year 10, initial survival crisis should be past. Library should be organized, functional, and growing.

**Check:** Do you have catalog? Is it current? Are critical texts copied and distributed?

### Year 20: Distributed Library Network Across Multiple Communities

**Metrics:**
- At least three communities maintain libraries
- Communities share catalogs
- Regular exchange of copied texts to fill gaps
- Each community has core collection (Tier 1 and 2 texts)
- Network survives loss of one community

**Why:** Single community is vulnerable. Network is resilient. By year 20, you should have built knowledge-sharing relationships.

**Check:** If your community disappeared tomorrow, would knowledge survive in allied communities?

### Year 50: No Knowledge Lost, New Texts Being Added

**Metrics:**
- No critical texts have been lost
- Libraries contain more texts than year 1 (copies from other communities, new writings)
- Printing press functional (if Chapter 4.5 followed)
- Next generation trained (librarians, scribes, users)
- Culture of knowledge preservation established

**Why:** By year 50, the generation that remembers pre-collapse is dying. If you have successfully preserved and transmitted knowledge, your grandchildren are better equipped than you were at year 0.

**Check:** Has any critical knowledge been lost? Is the next generation trained? Is preservation culture self-sustaining?

## CONCLUSION: KNOWLEDGE PRESERVATION IS NOT OPTIONAL

You have read this chapter. Now act.

**This guide is worthless if there's only one copy.**

**Copy it. Now.**

**Create climate-controlled storage. Now.**

**Catalog your books. Now.**

**Train librarians. Now.**

**Establish copying protocols. Now.**

**Distribute backups. Now.**

Knowledge dies in a single generation if not preserved. But properly preserved, knowledge is immortal.

You are the link between the past and the future. The knowledge of thousands of years of human civilization rests in books. Those books rest in your hands.

Preserve them. Copy them. Distribute them. Guard them.

Your grandchildren will curse you if you fail. They will thank you if you succeed.

**The choice is yours. Choose preservation.**
