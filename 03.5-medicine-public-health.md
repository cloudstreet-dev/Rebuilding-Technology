# Chapter 3.5: Medicine and Public Health

## Why This Chapter Could Save More Lives Than Any Other

In a post-collapse scenario, disease will kill far more people than violence, starvation, or accidents combined. Throughout history, the leading cause of death in any crisis has been infectious disease spreading through populations with compromised sanitation and no medical infrastructure. A single case of dysentery in a community without proper water treatment can cascade into an epidemic that kills half the population within weeks.

This chapter covers Tier 1 medical technology - the interventions that can be implemented immediately with minimal resources but provide the maximum reduction in mortality. These are the practices that, if implemented correctly, can reduce death rates from 50% to 5% during the critical first years of rebuilding.

**CRITICAL SAFETY WARNING**: Medicine is perhaps the most dangerous knowledge in this book. Every remedy, procedure, and treatment described here can kill if done incorrectly. Dosages matter. Cleanliness matters. Diagnosis matters. When in doubt, do less rather than more. "First, do no harm" is not just a philosophical principle - it is a practical survival rule. A person who dies from infection might have lived. A person who dies from your treatment is dead because of you.

## Section 1: Disease Prevention - The Foundation of Everything

### Why Prevention Matters More Than Treatment

Treating cholera is difficult and resource-intensive, with significant mortality even when done correctly. Preventing cholera requires digging latrines downhill from water sources. The mathematics are overwhelming: prevention is 100 times more effective than treatment for nearly every disease that will threaten your community.

### The Three Pillars of Disease Prevention

**1. Sanitation (Stopping Disease Before It Starts)**

Human waste is the single greatest disease vector in any post-collapse scenario. Every traditional society that survived long-term figured this out.

Latrine Placement Rules (Non-Negotiable):
- Minimum 50 meters from any water source
- Downhill from all wells, springs, or streams
- Downhill from living areas if possible
- Minimum 1.5 meters deep
- Cover waste with dirt/ash after each use
- New latrine when 0.5 meters from full

The "50 meter rule" is not arbitrary. Water-borne pathogens can travel through soil, but rarely more than 50 meters before being filtered out by earth. Breaking this rule will result in contaminated water supplies and epidemic disease.

Waste Management System:
- Designate specific defecation areas away from everything else
- Never defecate near water, even if you bury it
- Bury all waste immediately (cats have the right idea)
- Mark latrine areas clearly to prevent accidental contact
- Move latrines seasonally if possible

Hand Washing (The Single Most Important Medical Intervention):
- Wash hands after using latrine (ALWAYS)
- Wash hands before handling food (ALWAYS)
- Wash hands before treating wounds or assisting childbirth (ALWAYS)
- Use soap if available, ash and water if not
- Scrub for 20 seconds minimum (sing a short song)

The hand washing rule prevented more deaths than every antibiotic combined when it was first introduced to Vienna General Hospital in 1847. It will do the same for you.

**2. Quarantine (Stopping Disease After It Starts)**

When someone shows symptoms of infectious disease, isolation must be immediate and strict.

Quarantine Protocol:
- Separate sick individuals immediately
- Minimum 10 meters from healthy people
- Dedicated caregiver(s) who do not interact with healthy people
- All items used by sick person stay in quarantine area
- Burn or boil all materials that contacted sick person
- Caregivers wash thoroughly before any contact with others
- Quarantine continues 7 days after symptoms end

This seems harsh. It is. It is also the difference between one sick person and everyone sick.

Recognizing Contagious Disease:
- Fever + respiratory symptoms = quarantine (could be flu, pneumonia, TB)
- Fever + diarrhea = quarantine (could be cholera, dysentery, typhoid)
- Fever + rash = quarantine (could be measles, smallpox if it reemerges)
- Persistent cough lasting weeks = quarantine (likely tuberculosis)
- Yellow eyes/skin + fever = quarantine (could be hepatitis)

When in doubt, quarantine. The cost of unnecessary quarantine is inconvenience. The cost of delayed quarantine is mass death.

**3. Vaccination Concepts (Long-Term Prevention)**

You likely cannot produce vaccines immediately post-collapse, but you need to understand the principle for when you can.

Vaccination works by exposing the body to a weakened or dead version of a pathogen, allowing the immune system to prepare defenses without experiencing the disease. This was discovered by observing that people who survived certain diseases never got them again.

Primitive Vaccination (Variolation):
This technique was used for smallpox before modern vaccines. It involves taking material from a mild case of disease and introducing it to a healthy person, usually resulting in a mild case and subsequent immunity.

**WARNING**: Variolation is extremely dangerous and can cause full-blown disease and death. Only attempt if facing a disease with very high mortality (>20%) and no other options. Even then, the risks are severe.

If you must attempt variolation:
- Use material only from mild cases
- Introduce through small scratch, not deep wound
- Quarantine recipient completely during illness
- Understand that 1-2% may still die from the procedure
- This is a desperation measure only

Modern vaccine production requires Tier 3+ technology (laboratory culture, attenuation techniques, quality control). Do not attempt to reinvent this early. Focus on sanitation and quarantine until you have the infrastructure to do it safely.

## Section 2: Water and Sanitation - Expanded Details

This expands on **Chapter -1 (Immediate Survival)** with medical specifics. For foundational sanitation and water purification, see Chapter -1 first.

### Water-Borne Diseases You Are Trying to Prevent

Understanding what you are fighting helps maintain discipline in water treatment:

- Cholera: Causes catastrophic diarrhea, death from dehydration in hours, 50% mortality untreated
- Dysentery: Bloody diarrhea, severe dehydration, kills slowly over days
- Typhoid: Sustained fever, internal bleeding, 20% mortality untreated
- Hepatitis A: Liver damage, long recovery, can be fatal
- Giardia: Chronic diarrhea, malnutrition, debilitating but rarely fatal
- Cryptosporidium: Severe diarrhea, particularly dangerous for young and old

Every one of these spreads through the fecal-oral route: human waste contaminates water, people drink contaminated water, people defecate more contaminated waste. Breaking this cycle is simple in theory and requires constant vigilance in practice.

### Water Treatment Methods (In Order of Effectiveness)

**Boiling (Most Reliable)**
- Bring to rolling boil for 1 minute (3 minutes above 2000m elevation)
- Kills all bacteria, viruses, and parasites
- Does not remove chemical contamination
- Requires fuel (significant in long-term)
- Let cool, do not add contaminated ice or containers

**Sand Filtration (Best Long-Term Solution)**
Build a slow sand filter:
- Large container (barrel, clay vessel, wood box lined with clay)
- Bottom layer: 5cm gravel (largest stones)
- Second layer: 10cm gravel (medium stones)
- Third layer: 10cm coarse sand
- Top layer: 30cm fine sand
- Water enters top, drains from bottom

The filter must "ripen" over 2-4 weeks as a biological layer forms on sand surface. This layer does most of the filtering. Do not disturb it. When flow slows, scrape off top 1cm of sand, add new sand. This filter can last years.

Flow rate: Slow. One cubic meter of filter surface can purify about 100-200 liters per day. This is not fast, which is why you cannot skip building this on day one.

**Solar Disinfection (SODIS)**
- Fill clear plastic or glass bottles with water
- Lay in direct sunlight for 6 hours (2 days if cloudy)
- UV radiation kills pathogens
- Works better at higher elevations (more UV)
- Does not work with turbid (cloudy) water - filter first

**Chemical Disinfection**
If you have chlorine (from Chapter 3 chemistry):
- 2 drops household bleach per liter (if bleach is 5% chlorine)
- Wait 30 minutes before drinking
- Water should have slight chlorine smell (if not, dose was too low)
- If water is cloudy, double the dose

**What Does NOT Reliably Purify Water**:
- Letting it sit (some settling of particles, but bacteria remain)
- Alcohol added to water (not enough concentration)
- Praying over it (feel free to also pray, but still boil it)

### Well Construction and Maintenance

A properly constructed well is worth more than gold.

Well Site Selection:
- Highest ground available in area
- Minimum 50 meters from any latrine
- Minimum 30 meters from animal pens
- Uphill from all contamination sources
- Near where people live (if people walk far for water, they will take shortcuts)

Well Construction:
- Dig until you hit water table, then 2 meters deeper
- Line with stones, fired clay rings, or wood (anything to prevent collapse)
- Wall must extend above ground level to prevent surface water entry
- Cover top completely - no open wells
- Install hand pump or windlass bucket system
- Build drainage away from well (standing water near well = contamination)

Well Maintenance:
- Keep area around well clean and dry
- Never wash anything at the well
- Never let bucket touch ground
- One designated bucket for this well only
- Inspect well monthly for cracks in lining
- If water becomes cloudy or smells bad, stop use and investigate

### Community Hygiene Rules

These rules must become cultural bedrock:

1. No one defecates within 50 meters of water
2. Everyone washes hands after defecating and before eating
3. No washing of clothing or bodies in drinking water sources
4. Kitchen waste goes to compost, not to water
5. Animal pens are never uphill of wells
6. Sick people use dedicated latrine or have waste buried immediately

Enforce these rules absolutely. Public shaming for violations is appropriate - these violations kill children.

## Section 3: Herbal Medicine and Traditional Remedies (Evidence-Based)

### The Truth About Herbal Medicine

Most traditional herbal remedies are:
- Mildly effective at best
- Placebo effect
- Actively harmful
- Impossible to dose correctly

However, some herbal medicines genuinely work because they contain the same active compounds that modern pharmaceuticals are based on. This section covers only remedies with proven efficacy and relatively safe therapeutic windows.

**SAFETY WARNING**: "Natural" does not mean "safe." Many plants are deadly poison. Never use a remedy unless you are 100% certain of plant identification and dosing.

### Herbal Remedies That Actually Work

**Willow Bark (Aspirin Precursor)**

Active ingredient: Salicin, which metabolizes to salicylic acid (aspirin)

Uses:
- Pain relief (mild to moderate)
- Fever reduction
- Inflammation reduction

Identification:
- Willow trees (Salix species) near water
- Long, narrow leaves
- Flexible branches
- Bark is rough and grayish

Preparation:
- Harvest bark from young branches (2-3 years old)

- Chop bark finely
- Boil 1-2 teaspoons chopped bark per cup water for 10 minutes
- Strain and drink
- Dosage: 1-2 cups per day maximum

**WARNING**: Do not give to children with fever (risk of Reye's syndrome - a potentially fatal condition affecting liver and brain). Do not use if allergic to aspirin. Can cause stomach upset and bleeding. Not for use during pregnancy.

**For children's fevers, use instead:**
- Cool compresses (wet cloth on forehead, wrists, ankles)
- Tepid sponge bath (not cold - causes shivering which raises temperature)
- Fluids (prevents dehydration)
- Rest in cool environment
- Most fevers are self-limiting and don't require medication

**Yarrow (Wound Treatment)**

Active ingredients: Tannins (astringent), volatile oils (antibacterial)

Uses:
- Stop bleeding from wounds
- Reduce inflammation
- Mild antibacterial

Identification:
- Feathery, fern-like leaves
- White or pink flower clusters (flat-topped)
- Strong aromatic smell
- Common in meadows and roadsides

Preparation:
- Harvest leaves and flowers
- Fresh plant: Crush and apply directly to wound
- Dried plant: Make tea (1 tablespoon per cup boiling water), use to wash wound
- Can also make poultice: Pour boiling water over dried herb, let cool slightly, wrap in cloth, apply to wound

**Plantain (Wound Treatment and Insect Bites)**

Active ingredients: Tannins, allantoin (promotes healing)

Uses:
- Draw out infection and venom
- Promote wound healing
- Reduce inflammation from insect bites

Identification:
- Broad or narrow leaves in rosette pattern
- Parallel veins in leaves
- Extremely common in lawns and disturbed soil
- Called "white man's footprint" by some indigenous peoples because it follows human settlement

Preparation:
- Harvest fresh leaves
- Chew to bruise (or pound with rock if you prefer)
- Apply directly to wound, bite, or sting
- Replace every few hours
- Works remarkably well for bee stings and minor infections

**Garlic (Antibacterial)**

Active ingredient: Allicin (broad-spectrum antibacterial)

Uses:
- Fight bacterial infections
- Prevent infection in wounds (external use)
- Possibly helpful for intestinal parasites

Preparation:
- Crush fresh garlic to activate allicin
- For internal use: Eat 2-3 cloves per day (raw is more effective)
- For external use: Crush and apply to infected wounds (WARNING: Can burn skin, monitor closely)
- For ear infections: Infuse crushed garlic in warm olive oil, strain, drop into ear

**WARNING**: Can interact with blood-thinning properties of other herbs. Strong irritant to skin and stomach in high doses.

**Ginger (Nausea, Inflammation)**

Active ingredient: Gingerol (anti-nausea, anti-inflammatory)

Uses:
- Reduce nausea and vomiting
- Reduce inflammation
- Aid digestion

Preparation:
- Grate fresh ginger root

Uses:
- Relieve digestive upset
- Reduce nausea
- Relieve headache (topical)

Preparation:
- Steep fresh or dried leaves in boiling water
- Drink as tea
- For headache: Crush fresh leaves and rub on temples

Very safe herb with few side effects.

**Echinacea (Immune Support)**

Active ingredients: Polysaccharides, alkamides (immune stimulation)

Uses:
- May reduce duration of colds
- May help fight infections

Preparation:
- Use roots primarily (most active compounds)
- Boil 1 teaspoon dried root in 1 cup water for 10 minutes
- Drink 3 cups per day at onset of illness
- Use for maximum 2 weeks at a time

Evidence is mixed but some studies show benefit. Worth trying for colds.

### Remedies to AVOID (Despite Traditional Use)

**Comfrey**: Contains pyrrolizidine alkaloids that cause severe liver damage. Never ingest. Historical use as poultice is less dangerous but still questionable.

**Pennyroyal**: Extremely toxic. Historically used to induce abortion but frequently fatal to mother as well. Never use.

**Ephedra**: Contains ephedrine. Can cause heart problems, stroke, death. Risk outweighs any benefit.

**Coltsfoot**: Like comfrey, contains liver-toxic pyrrolizidine alkaloids.

**Chaparral**: Causes severe liver damage.

In general: If a traditional remedy was used to "cleanse the liver," it probably damages the liver. The historical understanding of liver function was wrong, and many of these remedies cause the exact problem they claimed to fix.

## Section 4: Wound Care and Basic Surgery

### The Hierarchy of Wound Treatment

1. Prevention (don't get wounded)
2. Cleaning (remove all contamination)
3. Closure (bring edges together if appropriate)
4. Protection (keep clean during healing)
5. Monitoring (watch for infection)

Most wound deaths are from infection, not blood loss. Your primary enemy is bacteria.

### Tetanus (Lockjaw) - The Silent Killer from Soil

Tetanus deserves special attention because it is both extremely dangerous and entirely preventable through proper wound care. Without modern antitoxin, tetanus has 50%+ mortality rate. It was historically one of the leading causes of death from wounds.

**What is Tetanus:**
- Caused by Clostridium tetani bacteria found in soil, dust, and animal feces
- Bacteria enter through wounds and produce neurotoxin
- Toxin causes severe muscle spasms starting with jaw (hence "lockjaw")
- Spasms can be strong enough to break bones
- Death usually from respiratory failure (spasms of breathing muscles)

**High-Risk Wounds:**
- **Puncture wounds** (nails, thorns, deep stabs) - highest risk because deep wounds have low oxygen, which tetanus bacteria prefer
- Wounds contaminated with soil, dirt, or manure
- Crush injuries
- Burns
- Wounds with dead tissue (necrosis)
- Bites (animal or human)

**Low-Risk Wounds:**
- Clean, superficial cuts
- Wounds treated immediately
- Wounds in well-vascularized areas (lots of blood flow)

**Symptoms** (appear 3-21 days after injury, average 10 days):
- **Jaw stiffness** (difficulty opening mouth) - usually first symptom
- Difficulty swallowing
- Stiffness spreading to neck, then chest, back, abdomen
- **Muscle spasms** triggered by noise, light, or touch
- Spasms become progressively more severe and frequent
- "Risus sardonicus" (grotesque grin from facial muscle spasms)
- **Opisthotonus** (body arches backward from back muscle spasms)
- Fever and sweating
- Rapid heartbeat
- Difficulty breathing (fatal without intervention)

**Treatment (Without Antitoxin):**

Modern treatment requires tetanus antitoxin and muscle relaxants. Without these, treatment is supportive only:

1. **Wound Care** (even if symptoms already present):
   - Clean wound thoroughly (remove all dead tissue and contamination)
   - Leave wound open to air (tetanus bacteria die in presence of oxygen)
   - Do not close wound

2. **Supportive Care:**
   - **Quiet, dark room** (reduces stimulus that triggers spasms)
   - Minimal noise, light, and physical contact
   - Sedation if available (alcohol, opiates - see warnings in Section 6)
   - Soft foods and liquids (difficulty swallowing)
   - **Nutrition critical** (body burns enormous energy during spasms)
   - Hydration

3. **Monitor Breathing:**
   - Most deaths from respiratory muscle spasms
   - If breathing becomes labored, keep airway clear
   - Patient may need assistance breathing (extremely difficult without equipment)

**Reality Check:**
Without antitoxin, mortality is 50-80%. With good supportive care in quiet environment, survival improves slightly. Recovery takes weeks to months even for survivors. The toxin must wear off naturally - there is no way to neutralize it without modern medicine.

**Prevention (The Only Real Solution):**

1. **Thorough Wound Cleaning** (critical for all wounds):
   - Immediately clean ANY wound that breaks skin
   - **Puncture wounds especially**: Irrigate deeply with clean water under pressure
   - Remove all dirt, debris, dead tissue
   - Allow wound to bleed briefly (flushes bacteria out)
   - For deep punctures, do NOT close wound - pack loosely and allow to heal from inside out

2. **High-Risk Wound Protocol:**
   - Clean as above
   - Check wound daily for signs of infection or tetanus
   - If any jaw stiffness appears, suspect tetanus immediately
   - Keep wound open to air (oxygen kills tetanus bacteria)

3. **General Prevention:**
   - Wear shoes (prevents puncture wounds from stepping on contaminated objects)
   - Wear gloves when working with soil, tools, or animals
   - Treat even minor wounds seriously

**Historical Note:**
Before tetanus vaccine (1924) and antitoxin, tetanus killed millions. It was especially common in agricultural societies and in wars (wounded soldiers). Post-collapse, it will return as a major threat unless wound care discipline is strict.

**Tetanus vs. Other Infections:**
Tetanus is unusual because:
- Symptoms are from toxin, not infection at wound site
- Wound may appear healed when symptoms start
- Symptoms are neurological (muscle spasms), not wound-related (pus, redness)
- Once symptoms appear, treatment is very difficult

This is why prevention through meticulous wound cleaning is essential. Every puncture wound should be assumed to carry tetanus risk and treated accordingly.

### Immediate Wound Response

**For bleeding wounds:**
1. Direct pressure (push hard on wound with cleanest cloth available)
2. Elevate if possible (raise wound above heart)
3. Maintain pressure for 5-10 minutes without checking if bleeding stopped (checking releases forming clots)
4. If blood soaks through, add more cloth on top (do not remove original cloth)
5. If bleeding does not stop after 10 minutes of solid pressure, consider arterial bleeding

**For arterial bleeding (bright red spurting blood):**
- Pressure point proximal to wound (between wound and heart)
- Tourniquet only if pressure fails and death is imminent
- Tourniquet location: Between wound and heart, never over joint
- Tourniquet must be tight enough to stop ALL blood flow
- Note exact time tourniquet applied
- Do not remove tourniquet once applied (removal can cause shock)
- Tissue death begins after 2 hours with tourniquet
- Tourniquet means probable loss of limb but saved life

**CRITICAL**: A loose tourniquet is worse than no tourniquet. It blocks veins but not arteries, increasing bleeding. If you apply tourniquet, make it tight.

### Wound Cleaning Protocol

This is the single most important step. A clean wound rarely gets infected. A dirty wound almost always gets infected.

Cleaning Steps:
1. Wash your hands thoroughly (use soap or ash, scrub for 30 seconds)
2. If available, wear clean gloves or wrap hands in clean cloth
3. Remove all visible dirt, debris, cloth fragments from wound
4. Irrigate wound with large amounts of clean water (boiled and cooled, or treated water)
5. Use syringe or squeeze bottle to create pressure wash effect
6. Continue irrigation until water runs clear
7. For deep wounds, irrigate inside wound channel
8. Use clean cloth to wipe away debris (one wipe per cloth section, do not reuse)

If you have disinfectant:
- Alcohol (ethanol): Pour directly into wound (will hurt, this is acceptable)
- Iodine solution: Dilute 1:10 with clean water, irrigate wound
- Honey: Apply to wound after cleaning (sounds medieval, actually works - antibacterial)
- Garlic: Crush and apply (antibacterial but irritating)

What NOT to put in wounds:
- Dirt or spider webs (traditional but introduces infection)
- Kerosene or gasoline (tissue damage)
- Urine (contaminated, despite survival myths)

### Wound Closure

**Should you close this wound?**

Close if:
- Clean wound
- Edges can be brought together without tension
- Less than 6 hours old (after 6 hours, bacteria have colonized too deeply)
  - **Exception**: **Facial wounds** can sometimes be closed up to 24 hours due to excellent blood supply (reduces infection risk)
  - **Exception**: **Scalp wounds** similar - rich blood supply allows longer closure window
  - These exceptions apply only to clean facial/scalp wounds, not contaminated or bite wounds
- Not a bite wound
- Not already showing signs of infection

Do NOT close if:
- Contaminated wound (dirt, debris, feces)
- Bite wound (animal or human - high infection risk)
- More than 6 hours old
- Signs of infection (redness, swelling, pus, red streaks)
- Ragged edges that cannot meet
- Deep puncture wound

Wounds that should not be closed must heal by "secondary intention" (from inside out). Pack loosely with clean cloth, change dressing daily, allow to gradually fill in.

**Closure Methods:**

*Suturing (Stitches):*

Needle: Can be made from bone, thorn, or metal. Metal is best. Sterilize by boiling or holding in flame until red hot, then cooling.

Thread: Modern thread if available. Natural alternatives: Plant fibers (boiled), animal sinew (boiled), human hair (washed thoroughly). Use the finest thread that will hold.

Suturing technique:
- Start 0.5cm from wound edge
- Insert needle perpendicular to skin
- Pass through both sides of wound at equal depth
- Bring edges together without excessive tension
- Tie square knot
- Cut ends 0.5cm from knot
- Space stitches 0.5-1cm apart
- Remove stitches after 7-10 days for most areas (14 days for joints)

Each stitch is independent - if one breaks, others hold.

*Butterfly Bandages:*
Cut strips of cloth or tape to create butterfly shape. Apply across wound to pull edges together. Less secure than stitches but useful for shallow wounds. Change daily.

*Natural Adhesives:*
Pine pitch (heated and applied) can seal small wounds. Not as strong as sutures but better than nothing.

### Infection Recognition and Management

**Signs of infection:**
- Increased pain (wound should hurt less over time, not more)
- Redness spreading from wound
- Swelling
- Heat
- Pus (yellow, green, or brown fluid)
- Red streaks radiating from wound (lymphangitis - very serious)
- Fever
- Foul smell

**If infection develops:**
1. Remove any sutures immediately (allows drainage)
2. Clean wound thoroughly again
3. If abscess (pocket of pus), it must be drained:
   - Sterilize knife/scalpel
   - **Lance at point of maximum fluctuance** (where it feels softest/most fluid-filled when you press gently)
     - This is where pus has collected closest to surface
     - May not be the point of maximum swelling - swelling can be firm tissue reaction; fluctuance is fluid
     - Test by gentle palpation: fluctuant area will feel like pressing on a water balloon
   - Make incision over fluctuant point
   - Express pus gently
   - Irrigate cavity with clean water
   - Pack loosely with clean cloth (prevents closing too soon)
   - Change packing daily
4. Apply heat (warm compresses) to increase blood flow
5. If you have antibiotics, start immediately
6. If you have garlic or honey, apply to wound

**Red streaks (lymphangitis):**
This means infection is spreading through lymph system toward heart. This is a medical emergency. The person will die without treatment.
- Start antibiotics immediately if available
- Apply heat to affected area
- Elevate limb
- If no antibiotics available and streaks continue advancing, amputation may be necessary to save life

### Amputation (The Terrible Choice)

Amputation becomes necessary when:
- Crush injury with destroyed blood supply
- Severe infection not responding to treatment with red streaks advancing
- Gangrene (tissue death - black tissue, horrible smell)
- Limb unsalvageable and threatening life

This is a decision you hope never to make. However, a person with one leg can live. A person with systemic infection from a dying leg cannot.

**Pre-amputation preparation:**
- Patient must understand this is necessary to save their life
- Clean and sterilize all tools (boil for 30 minutes)
- You need: Sharp saw (serrated), sharp knife, needle and thread, tourniquets, clean cloths
- Prepare sedation if available (alcohol, willow bark tea, poppy if available)
- Prepare blood loss management (clean cloths, bandages)
- Choose amputation site: Through joint if possible (easier), or through bone at point where tissue is still healthy

**Amputation procedure:**
1. Apply tourniquet well above amputation site
2. Mark cut line on skin (circular, 5cm below where bone will be cut)
3. Cut through skin and muscle in circular fashion
4. Pull skin and muscle upward
5. Cut bone 5cm above skin cut line (this allows skin to cover bone end)
6. Remove limb
7. Smooth bone edges with file or knife
8. Identify and tie off major blood vessels (tie with thread, double knot)
9. Release tourniquet briefly to identify bleeding vessels, tie them off
10. Pull skin flap over bone end
11. Suture skin closed (do not close too tight - leave room for drainage)
12. Apply sterile dressing
13. Monitor obsessively for infection

**Post-amputation care:**
- High infection risk - watch constantly
- Change dressings daily
- If infection develops, may need to remove some stitches for drainage
- Patient will need support and time to adapt
- Phantom pain is real and normal

**REALITY CHECK**: Amputation has high mortality even in best circumstances. Historical survival rate was roughly 50%. Modern improved survival is from antibiotics, blood transfusion, and sterile technique. Do everything possible to avoid reaching this point.

### Burns - Common and Dangerous Injuries

Burns are among the most common injuries post-collapse (cooking fires, heating, accidents with hot materials) and have specific treatment requirements that differ from other wounds.

**Burn Classification:**

**First-Degree Burns** (Superficial):
- Affects only outer skin layer (epidermis)
- Red, painful, no blisters
- Example: Mild sunburn
- Heals in 3-7 days without scarring

**Second-Degree Burns** (Partial Thickness):
- Affects epidermis and upper dermis
- Red, very painful, blisters form
- Example: Severe sunburn, scalding
- Heals in 2-3 weeks, may scar

**Third-Degree Burns** (Full Thickness):
- Destroys all skin layers
- White, brown, or black appearance
- May be painless (nerve endings destroyed)
- Does not heal on its own - requires skin grafting or heals very slowly from edges
- High infection risk
- High mortality without modern care

**Immediate Treatment (First Minutes):**

1. **Stop the burning process:**
   - Remove from heat source
   - Remove clothing (unless stuck to burn - leave it)
   - Remove jewelry near burn (swelling will make removal impossible later)

2. **Cool the burn immediately:**
   - **Cool (not cold) clean water** for 10-20 minutes
   - **DO NOT use ice** (causes further tissue damage)
   - DO NOT use butter, oil, or other folk remedies (traps heat, increases infection risk)
   - For chemical burns, flush with large amounts of water

3. **Assess severity:**
   - Size: Palm-sized = roughly 1% of body surface area
   - Depth: First, second, or third degree
   - Location: Face, hands, feet, genitals, or joints are higher risk
   - >10% second-degree or >2% third-degree = life-threatening

**Ongoing Treatment:**

**For First-Degree Burns:**
- Keep clean
- Cool compresses for pain
- Aloe vera (if available) soothes pain
- Heals on its own

**For Second-Degree Burns:**

1. **Blister Care:**
   - **DO NOT break blisters** (they protect underlying tissue)
   - If blister breaks on its own:
     - Clean gently with clean water
     - Do NOT remove dead skin (acts as natural bandage)
     - Cover with clean dressing

2. **Dressing:**
   - Cover with **clean, non-stick dressing**
   - Change dressing daily or if wet/dirty
   - Check for infection each dressing change

3. **Pain Management:**
   - Willow bark tea (see Section 3)
   - Cool (not cold) compresses
   - Elevation reduces pain and swelling

**For Third-Degree Burns:**
- Cover with clean, moist dressing
- Do not attempt to clean or debride initially
- High infection risk - antibiotics critical if available
- Fluid replacement essential (see below)
- Without modern care (skin grafting), survival depends on size and location

**Honey for Burn Treatment:**

Honey is **evidence-based** for burn treatment:
- Natural antibacterial properties (high sugar content, hydrogen peroxide production, low pH)
- Promotes healing
- Reduces scarring
- Keeps wound moist

**Application:**
- Clean burn gently with clean water
- Apply layer of honey (1-2mm thick)
- Cover with clean dressing
- Change dressing and reapply honey daily
- Continue until healed

**Clinical evidence**: Multiple studies show honey performs as well as or better than silver sulfadiazine (modern burn cream) for partial-thickness burns. This is not folk medicine - it genuinely works.

**Fluid Replacement (Critical for Large Burns):**

Burns cause massive fluid loss through damaged skin. Dehydration kills.

**Signs needing aggressive fluid replacement:**
- Burns >10% body surface area
- Dark urine or no urination
- Rapid heartbeat
- Confusion
- Dry mouth

**Treatment:**
- Oral rehydration solution (see Section 9 - same formula as for diarrhea)
- Drink constantly - may need 5-10 liters per day for large burns
- Monitor urine output (should be light yellow and flowing)
- If unable to drink (facial burns, unconscious), needs IV fluids (very difficult without equipment)

**Infection Watch (Major Killer):**

Burn wounds are highly prone to infection:

**Signs of infection:**
- Increased pain
- Increased redness around burn
- Pus or foul smell
- Fever
- Red streaks from burn

**Treatment:**
- Clean wound
- Honey application
- Antibiotics if available
- If infection spreads, life-threatening - aggressive treatment needed

**Long-Term Burn Care:**

- **Scarring**: Second and third-degree burns scar. Massage with oil may help flexibility.
- **Contractures**: Scars across joints can limit movement. Gentle stretching during healing helps.
- **Psychological**: Severe burns are traumatic and disfiguring. Emotional support matters.

**Prevention (Worth Emphasis):**

Burns are often preventable:
- Careful fire management
- Keep children away from cooking fires
- Handle hot materials with protection
- Test water temperature before bathing children
- Safe storage of hot coals

**Reality Check:**

Large third-degree burns (>20% body surface area) have very high mortality without modern burn units. Skin grafting, IV antibiotics, and advanced fluid management are needed. Do everything possible to prevent burns and treat small burns aggressively to prevent infection.

### Fractures and Splinting

Broken bones are common and, while not immediately life-threatening, improper treatment can lead to permanent disability, infection (if compound), or complications.

**Types of Fractures:**

**Simple (Closed) Fracture:**
- Bone broken but skin intact
- Lower infection risk
- Can often heal well with proper immobilization

**Compound (Open) Fracture:**
- Bone breaks through skin
- High infection risk
- Requires wound care PLUS fracture care
- Can be life-threatening if infection develops

**Recognizing Fractures:**

Signs of broken bone:
- Severe pain at injury site
- Swelling
- Deformity (limb bent at wrong angle, abnormal shape)
- Inability to use or bear weight on limb
- Grinding or popping sound at time of injury
- Bone visible through skin (compound fracture - obvious)

**Immediate Care:**

1. **DO NOT move injured person unless necessary** (moving can worsen fracture)

2. **Control bleeding if compound fracture:**
   - Cover wound with cleanest cloth available
   - Apply pressure around wound (not on protruding bone)
   - Treat wound per Section 4 protocols after stabilization

3. **Immobilize before moving:**
   - Splint bone in position found (do not try to straighten unless circulation compromised)
   - Exception: If hand/foot is blue/white/cold (no blood flow), gentle traction may be needed

**Splinting Technique:**

**Purpose of splint:**
- Prevent bone movement
- Reduce pain
- Prevent further damage to surrounding tissue
- Reduce risk of simple fracture becoming compound

**Splinting rules:**
- **Immobilize joint above AND below fracture**
  - Example: Forearm fracture = immobilize wrist AND elbow
- **Pad splint** (prevents pressure sores)
- **Check circulation** after splinting (critical!)

**Improvised Splint Materials:**
- Straight sticks or boards
- Rolled newspapers or magazines
- Cardboard
- Tree branches
- Rolled cloth or blankets
- SAM splint (moldable splint - salvage if possible)

**Splinting Procedure:**

1. **Gather materials:**
   - Two rigid supports (boards, sticks) long enough to span from joint above to joint below fracture
   - Padding (cloth, moss, grass, anything soft)
   - Ties (cloth strips, rope, vines)

2. **Apply padding:**
   - Wrap padding around limb at fracture site
   - Pad any bony prominences

3. **Position splints:**
   - Place rigid supports on opposite sides of limb (or three sides for more stability)
   - Splints should extend beyond joints above and below

4. **Secure splints:**
   - Tie at multiple points
   - Ties should be snug but not cutting off circulation
   - Tie above and below fracture site (not directly over fracture)

5. **Check circulation:**
   - Feel pulse below fracture (wrist pulse for arm, foot pulse for leg)
   - Check skin color (should be pink, not blue/white)
   - Check temperature (should be warm)
   - Check sensation (can patient feel touch?)
   - **If any of these are abnormal, loosen splint immediately**

6. **Elevate if possible:**
   - Reduces swelling
   - Reduces pain

**Special Cases:**

**Femur (Thigh Bone) Fracture:**
- Very dangerous (large bone, major blood vessels)
- Can cause life-threatening internal bleeding
- Requires traction splint (complex - pull on leg to keep bone ends separated)
- Without traction, muscle spasms pull bone ends together, causing severe pain and damage
- High mortality without modern care

**Compound Fractures:**
- **DO NOT push bone back in**
- Cover wound with sterile dressing
- Splint carefully
- Start antibiotics immediately if available (very high infection risk)
- Clean wound thoroughly once splinted (irrigation with clean water)
- Monitor obsessively for infection

**Skull Fracture:**
- Suspect if severe head injury with:
  - Clear fluid from nose/ears
  - Bruising around eyes or behind ears
  - Deformity of skull
- Keep person still
- Monitor consciousness
- Without modern care, treatment is supportive only
- High mortality if severe

**Healing Process:**

**Timeline:**
- Arm/hand: 6-8 weeks
- Leg/foot: 8-12 weeks
- Ribs: 6 weeks (no splinting possible, pain management only)
- Children: Faster (1/2 to 2/3 adult time)

**During healing:**
- Keep splint on for full healing time
- Check circulation daily
- Watch for infection if compound fracture
- Some movement of fingers/toes encouraged (prevents stiffness)
- No weight bearing on leg fractures until healed

**Complications:**

**Malunion** (heals in wrong position):
- Bone heals but crooked
- May cause chronic pain or disability
- Prevention: Good splinting initially

**Non-union** (doesn't heal):
- Rare but possible
- May need re-breaking and re-setting (grim without anesthesia)

**Infection** (in compound fractures):
- Can spread to bone (osteomyelitis)
- Very difficult to treat
- May require amputation if severe

**Compartment Syndrome:**
- Swelling in confined space cuts off blood flow
- Limb becomes extremely painful, tight, cold
- Medical emergency - without surgery (fasciotomy), limb dies
- Loosen splint immediately, elevate, pray

**When to Worry:**

Seek help or escalate care if:
- Compound fracture
- Femur fracture
- Skull fracture
- Any fracture with loss of circulation
- Any fracture showing signs of infection
- Fracture not improving after weeks

**Prevention:**
- Careful working practices
- Strong footwear
- Avoid heights
- Fall prevention (especially for elderly)

### Hypothermia and Hyperthermia - Temperature Emergencies

The human body has narrow temperature tolerance. Too cold or too hot kills quickly.

**Hypothermia (Too Cold):**

**Definition**: Core body temperature below 95°F (35°C)

**Causes:**
- Exposure to cold
- Wet clothing (evaporation accelerates heat loss)
- Wind (wind chill)
- Immersion in cold water
- Exhaustion (body cannot generate heat)

**Stages and Symptoms:**

**Mild Hypothermia (90-95°F / 32-35°C):**
- Shivering (body's attempt to generate heat)
- Confusion, poor judgment
- Slurred speech
- Fumbling hands (loss of fine motor control)
- Fatigue

**Moderate Hypothermia (82-90°F / 28-32°C):**
- Shivering stops (bad sign - body giving up)
- Severe confusion
- Drowsiness
- Slow, shallow breathing
- Weak pulse
- Blue lips and skin

**Severe Hypothermia (<82°F / <28°C):**
- Unconscious
- Very slow or absent pulse
- Very slow or absent breathing
- Appears dead (but may still be savable)

**Treatment:**

**Mild Hypothermia:**
1. Move to warm, dry environment
2. Remove wet clothing
3. Replace with dry clothing/blankets
4. Warm drinks (not alcohol - dilates blood vessels and worsens hypothermia)
5. Gradual warming (body to body contact, blankets, warm room)
6. High-energy food if conscious and able to swallow

**Moderate to Severe Hypothermia:**
1. Handle extremely gently (rough handling can cause heart to stop)
2. Check for breathing and pulse (may be very slow and hard to detect)
3. If no pulse/breathing, begin rescue breathing and chest compressions
4. Move to warm environment
5. Remove wet clothing (cut off rather than pulling over head)
6. Warm center of body first (chest, neck, head, groin) not extremities
7. **GRADUAL warming** (not hot water - causes shock)
   - Warm blankets
   - Body-to-body contact (strip and get under blankets with warm person)
   - Warm, moist compresses to chest, neck, groin
8. If conscious, warm sweet drinks
9. Keep horizontal (upright position can cause blood pressure drop)

**DO NOT:**
- Give alcohol (worsens hypothermia)
- Warm extremities first (causes cold blood to rush to heart, can be fatal)
- Use hot water or heat directly on skin (can burn, causes shock)
- Give up - people have recovered from severe hypothermia that looked like death

**Hyperthermia (Too Hot):**

**Heat Exhaustion** (Mild):
- Heavy sweating
- Weakness, fatigue
- Dizziness
- Nausea
- Headache
- Cool, pale, clammy skin
- Rapid heartbeat

**Heat Stroke** (Severe - MEDICAL EMERGENCY):
- High body temperature (>104°F / 40°C)
- Hot, dry skin (sweating has stopped - bad sign)
- Confusion, altered mental state
- Slurred speech
- Seizures
- Unconsciousness
- Rapid, strong heartbeat

**Treatment:**

**Heat Exhaustion:**
1. Move to cool, shaded environment
2. Remove excess clothing
3. Cool with wet cloths
4. Fan to increase evaporation
5. Give water or oral rehydration solution
6. Rest in cool environment

**Heat Stroke:**
1. **Cool immediately** (this is life-threatening emergency)
2. Move to shade/cool area
3. Remove clothing
4. Cool by any means available:
   - Immerse in cool water if possible
   - Wet sheets and fan
   - Apply ice/cold packs to neck, armpits, groin (major blood vessels)
   - Continuous water spray with fanning
5. Monitor consciousness
6. If conscious, give cool water to drink
7. Continue cooling until body temperature drops below 102°F (39°C)

**DO NOT:**
- Give alcohol
- Give salt tablets
- Apply ice directly to skin (can cause shock)

**Prevention:**

**Cold weather:**
- Layer clothing
- Stay dry
- Protect extremities (hands, feet, head)
- Avoid overexertion (sweating wets clothes)
- Seek shelter in extreme cold
- Eat high-energy foods

**Hot weather:**
- Work during cooler parts of day
- Rest in shade
- Drink water constantly (before thirsty)
- Wear light-colored, loose clothing
- Acclimatize gradually to heat
- Watch for symptoms in elderly and children (most vulnerable)

### Shock - The Silent Killer After Injury

Shock kills even after bleeding stops. It is a failure of the circulatory system to deliver blood to organs.

**What is Shock:**

The body's response to severe stress (injury, blood loss, infection, allergic reaction) causes blood vessels to dilate and blood to pool. Vital organs don't get enough oxygen. Without treatment, organs fail and person dies.

**Causes:**
- Blood loss (most common in trauma)
- Severe infection (septic shock)
- Severe allergic reaction (anaphylactic shock)
- Heart problems
- Severe dehydration
- Severe burns

**Recognizing Shock:**

**Early signs:**
- Rapid heartbeat (body trying to pump more blood)
- Rapid breathing (body trying to get more oxygen)
- Anxiety, restlessness
- Cool, clammy skin
- Pale skin, especially lips and nail beds

**Progressive shock:**
- Weak, thready pulse
- Confusion, disorientation
- Extreme thirst
- Shallow breathing
- Blue lips and fingernails (cyanosis)

**Severe shock:**
- Unconsciousness
- Barely detectable pulse
- Gasping, irregular breathing
- Death imminent

**Critical Understanding:**

Shock can kill even after the injury is managed. Someone who has stopped bleeding can still die from shock if blood pressure remains too low for too long. You must treat the injury AND the shock.

**Treatment:**

**Immediate actions:**

1. **Treat the cause:**
   - Stop bleeding
   - Treat wounds
   - Remove allergen if anaphylaxis
   - Begin treating infection if septic shock

2. **Position:**
   - Lay person flat on back
   - Elevate legs 12 inches (helps blood return to vital organs)
   - Exception: If head injury, chest injury, or difficulty breathing, elevate head slightly instead
   - Keep warm (but don't overheat - induces sweating and fluid loss)

3. **Keep warm:**
   - Cover with blankets
   - Prevent heat loss from ground (blanket underneath)
   - Do not apply heat (dilates blood vessels, worsens shock)

4. **Fluids:**
   - If conscious and able to swallow: Oral rehydration solution
   - Small sips frequently
   - Do NOT give fluids if unconscious (aspiration risk)
   - Without IV access, oral is only option

5. **Do NOT give:**
   - Alcohol (dilates blood vessels)
   - Food (if severe shock, body can't process it)
   - Anything to drink if unconscious

6. **Monitor:**
   - Pulse (check every 5-10 minutes)
   - Breathing
   - Consciousness level
   - Skin color and temperature

**What you cannot do without modern medicine:**

- IV fluids (gold standard for shock treatment - rapid fluid replacement)
- Blood transfusion (for shock from blood loss)
- Pressors (medications that constrict blood vessels)
- Surgical repair of internal bleeding

Without these interventions, severe shock has high mortality. Treatment is supportive: position, warmth, oral fluids if possible, and treating the underlying cause.

**Specific Types:**

**Hypovolemic Shock** (from blood/fluid loss):
- Most common in trauma
- Treat by stopping bleeding and replacing fluids
- Survival depends on how much blood lost

**Septic Shock** (from overwhelming infection):
- Requires antibiotics immediately
- Without antibiotics, very high mortality
- Also needs fluids

**Anaphylactic Shock** (severe allergic reaction):
- Rapidly progressive
- Causes airway swelling (can't breathe) and blood pressure collapse
- Needs epinephrine (adrenaline) injection - without it, mortality is high
- Remove allergen, position, fluids, keep airway open
- May need to perform emergency cricothyrotomy (cutting open airway in neck) if throat swells shut

**Key Point:**

Shock is why you must observe trauma patients for hours after injury. Someone who seems stable can deteriorate into shock. Watch for the early signs (rapid pulse, rapid breathing, pale skin) and treat aggressively.

### Snakebite and Envenomation

In areas with venomous snakes, bites will occur. Treatment is limited without antivenin, but supportive care can save lives.

**Identifying Venomous vs. Non-Venomous:**

This varies by region. General rules (not always reliable):
- **Triangular head** often indicates venomous (pit vipers)
- **Round pupils** = usually non-venomous; **Elliptical (slit) pupils** = often venomous
- **Single row of scales under tail** = venomous; **Double row** = non-venomous
- **Heat-sensing pits** between eye and nostril = pit viper (venomous)

**However**: Some deadly snakes (coral snakes, cobras) don't follow these rules. Learn local venomous species specifically.

**Immediate Response to Snakebite:**

**DO:**
1. **Keep calm and still** (movement spreads venom faster)
2. **Immobilize bitten limb** (splint if possible)
3. **Keep limb at or below heart level**
4. **Remove jewelry/tight clothing** from bitten limb (swelling will make removal impossible later)
5. **Mark edge of swelling** with pen (track progression)
6. **Note time of bite** (affects timing of symptoms)
7. **Get to help if any exists** (but move calmly, not running)

**DO NOT:**
- Cut the bite (causes more damage, introduces infection, doesn't remove venom)
- Suck out venom (doesn't work, exposes mouth to venom)
- Apply tourniquet (causes more damage, can cost limb)
- Apply ice (damages tissue)
- Give alcohol (worsens effects)
- Try to catch or kill snake (risk of second bite)
- Electric shock (doesn't work, just hurts)

**Note snake appearance if safe to do so** (helps identify species if medical care available), but don't risk second bite.

**Symptoms of Envenomation:**

**Local symptoms:**
- Pain at bite site (immediate to delayed)
- Swelling (may be massive)
- Bruising, discoloration
- Blisters
- Tissue death (necrosis) in severe cases

**Systemic symptoms:**
- Nausea, vomiting
- Weakness
- Sweating
- Rapid heartbeat
- Difficulty breathing (neurotoxic venom)
- Blurred vision
- Drooping eyelids
- Difficulty swallowing
- Bleeding from gums, nose (hemotoxic venom)
- Shock
- Seizures
- Paralysis

**Treatment Without Antivenin:**

Without antivenin (antivenom), treatment is supportive only. Survival depends on:
- Amount of venom injected
- Location of bite (closer to heart = faster spread)
- Species of snake
- Size/health of victim (children and elderly more vulnerable)

**Supportive Care:**

1. **Keep calm and immobile:**
   - Movement spreads venom faster
   - Psychological calm helps (panic increases heart rate)

2. **Clean wound:**
   - Wash gently with clean water
   - Do not scrub or cut
   - Cover with clean dressing

3. **Monitor vital signs:**
   - Breathing (most important - some venoms cause paralysis)
   - Pulse
   - Consciousness
   - Progression of swelling

4. **Support breathing:**
   - If breathing weakens, keep airway clear
   - May need assisted breathing (mouth-to-mouth)
   - Neurotoxic venom can cause respiratory paralysis - this is the usual cause of death

5. **Treat shock:**
   - Position flat, elevate unbitten limbs
   - Keep warm
   - Fluids if conscious

6. **Pain management:**
   - Willow bark tea
   - Avoid aspirin (increases bleeding if hemotoxic venom)
   - Opiates if available and severe pain (see Section 6 warnings)

7. **Watch for infection:**
   - Bite wound can become infected
   - Necrotic tissue (dead tissue from venom) is infection risk
   - Clean wound daily
   - Antibiotics if available

**Specific Venom Types:**

**Hemotoxic** (destroys blood and tissue - rattlesnakes, vipers):
- Massive swelling
- Bruising, bleeding
- Tissue death
- Treatment: Supportive care, watch for shock from blood loss

**Neurotoxic** (affects nervous system - cobras, coral snakes, some rattlesnakes):
- Weakness, paralysis
- Difficulty breathing
- Death from respiratory failure
- Treatment: Support breathing (this is critical - may need hours of assisted breathing)

**Reality Check:**

Without antivenin:
- Most venomous bites are survivable with good supportive care (snakes often inject only partial venom load)
- Some bites are "dry" (no venom injected) ~25% of the time
- Serious envenomation has ~10-20% mortality without antivenin (varies by species)
- Coral snake and cobra bites have higher mortality without antivenin
- Children and elderly have higher mortality

**Prevention:**
- Wear boots and long pants in snake habitat
- Watch where you put hands and feet
- Don't reach into holes or under logs
- Use stick to move debris before reaching
- Avoid snakes - give them space
- Most bites occur when people try to kill or capture snakes

**Long-Term Effects:**

Even survivors may have:
- Permanent tissue damage
- Loss of fingers/toes from necrosis
- Chronic pain
- Psychological trauma

## Section 5: Penicillin Production (Achievable Antibiotic)

This section could save more lives than everything else in this chapter combined.

### Why Penicillin?

Penicillin is the only antibiotic that can be produced with Tier 1 technology. It was literally discovered by accident in a petri dish. The organism that produces it (Penicillium mold) is common and easy to grow. The extraction process is achievable with basic chemistry.

Penicillin is effective against:
- Streptococcal infections (strep throat, scarlet fever)
- Pneumonia (bacterial)
- Syphilis
- Wound infections (many types)
- Gangrene (early stages)

Penicillin is NOT effective against:
- Viral infections (flu, common cold, most diarrhea)
- Many modern resistant bacteria (though post-collapse, resistance rates will drop)
- Fungal infections
- Parasites

**CRITICAL SAFETY WARNING**: Home-produced penicillin is dangerous. Contamination can introduce toxins. Allergic reactions can be fatal. Dosing is difficult without proper measurement. Use only when death from infection is likely. Commercial antibiotics are vastly safer if available.

### Growing Penicillium Mold

**Finding Penicillium:**
Penicillium is the blue-green mold that grows on bread, citrus fruits, and cheese. However, not all blue-green mold is Penicillium, and not all Penicillium produces useful amounts of penicillin.

Best source: Cantaloupe rinds. The original Penicillium chrysogenum strain came from cantaloupe.

**Cultivation:**

Medium #1 (Bread-based):
- Slice bread and allow to dry slightly
- Moisten with clean water (not soaking)
- Place in clean container
- Cover loosely (needs some air)
- Keep at room temperature (20-25°C ideal)
- Check daily for mold growth
- You want blue-green mold, not black or pink (those may be toxic)
- Once established, mold should cover bread in 5-7 days

Medium #2 (Liquid culture - better yield):
- Boil water with dissolved sugar (1 tablespoon per cup)
- Add corn steep liquor if available, or yeast extract, or even bread soaked and strained
- Cool to room temperature
- Add small amount of blue-green mold from bread culture
- Cover loosely
- Keep at room temperature
- Mold will grow on surface of liquid
- Ready for extraction after 7-14 days

**Identification of good Penicillium culture:**
- Blue-green color
- Powdery appearance
- No foul smell (should smell musty but not rotten)
- No pink, black, or yellow mold present (contamination)

### Extraction and Purification

**Basic Extraction (Low purity but functional):**

1. Strain liquid culture through clean cloth to remove mold mass
2. Acidify liquid by adding vinegar or lemon juice (reduces pH to 2-3)
3. Add solvent (ethyl acetate if available, or ether - both highly flammable)
4. Shake mixture vigorously for several minutes
5. Let settle - two layers will form
6. Carefully separate top layer (contains penicillin)
7. Evaporate solvent slowly (NOT over flame - use low heat or sun)
8. Yellow-brown residue remains - this contains penicillin

**SAFETY**: Solvents are highly flammable. Work outdoors. No flames.

**Improved Purification (if you have basic chemistry supplies):**

After basic extraction:
1. Dissolve residue in small amount of clean water
2. Add activated charcoal (make from hardwood - see Chapter 3)
3. Filter through cloth
4. Re-extract with solvent
5. Evaporate again
6. Dissolve in sterile water for use

The more purification steps, the safer the final product, but each step loses some penicillin.

### Testing

**Before using on humans, test:**

1. Sterility test:
   - Add small amount to sterile broth
   - If broth becomes cloudy in 24 hours, contamination present
   - Do not use contaminated product

2. Activity test:
   - Apply small amount to bacterial culture (from infected wound)
   - If bacteria stop growing in area where penicillin applied, it is active
   - No activity = no point in using

3. Allergy test:
   - Apply tiny amount to skin
   - Wait 24 hours
   - If severe rash, do not use
   - Note: This does not detect all allergic reactions (anaphylaxis can still occur)

**Penicillin allergy can be FATAL**: Symptoms include difficulty breathing, swelling of throat, rapid heartbeat, loss of consciousness. If these occur, stop penicillin immediately. Keep person lying down. There is no treatment for anaphylaxis without modern medicine. The person may die. This is why you test first and have someone monitoring the patient.

**Cross-Reactivity Warning**: If someone is allergic to penicillin, they may also react to related antibiotics:
- **Cephalosporins** (common salvaged antibiotics): ~10% cross-reactivity with penicillin allergy
- **Carbapenems**: Lower cross-reactivity but still possible
- If penicillin allergy known, use non-beta-lactam antibiotics if available (tetracycline, fluoroquinolones, macrolides like erythromycin)
- If only penicillin-type antibiotics available and person has mild penicillin allergy history, weigh risks: death from infection vs. possible allergic reaction
- If history of severe penicillin reaction (anaphylaxis), **do not use cephalosporins**

### Dosing

This is the hardest part without measurement equipment.

Historical dosing (pre-standardization):
- "One moldy bread slice worth" of culture, extracted and dissolved in water
- Administered every 4-6 hours
- Continued for at least 5 days after symptoms resolve

Modern knowledge suggests:
- Minimum effective dose for adult: Approximately 300-500mg every 6 hours
- Without scales, you cannot measure this accurately
- Start with small dose (what extracts from one slice worth of culture)
- Increase if no effect after 24 hours
- Watch for allergic reaction constantly

**Signs treatment is working:**
- Fever decreases
- Pain decreases
- Redness and swelling decrease
- Person feels better

**Signs of treatment failure:**
- Symptoms continue worsening after 48 hours
- New symptoms appear
- Person becomes more ill

If treatment fails, either the infection is not susceptible to penicillin, or your penicillin is not potent enough, or dosing is inadequate.

### Storage

Penicillin degrades over time:
- In solution: Use within 24 hours (store cool and dark)
- As dried powder: Weeks to months if kept dry and cool
- Protect from light, heat, and moisture
- Store in sealed container
- Label clearly with date of production

When in doubt, make fresh batches. Old penicillin loses potency but does not become dangerous (unlike some medicines that create toxic breakdown products).

### Reality Check on Penicillin Production

This process will not produce pharmaceutical-grade penicillin. Your yields will be low. Your purity will be questionable. Your potency will be uncertain. Contamination risk is real.

However, impure penicillin is better than no antibiotic when someone is dying of infection. The inventors of penicillin production during WWII faced similar challenges and still saved millions of lives.

Use this knowledge as a last resort, not a first choice. If you can salvage commercial antibiotics, do so. If you can trade for antibiotics, do so. But if the choice is between certain death from infection and risky home-produced penicillin, you now have an option.

## Section 6: Other Essential Medicines from Natural Sources

### Aspirin from Willow Bark (Expanded Detail)

See Section 3 for basic preparation. Here is how to concentrate it:

Semi-purified Aspirin Extraction:
1. Boil willow bark tea as described
2. Strain thoroughly
3. Evaporate liquid slowly to concentrate (low heat)
4. Thick syrup remains - contains concentrated salicin
5. Small doses (1 teaspoon) equal multiple cups of tea
6. Store in sealed container (cool and dark)
7. Use within weeks (degrades over time)

This is still not pure aspirin, but more potent and easier to dose than tea.

### Quinine from Cinchona Bark (Malaria Treatment)

Active ingredient: Quinine (antimalarial, also antipyretic and analgesic)

Source: Cinchona tree bark (native to South America, cultivated in some other regions)

If you are in a malarial region and can access cinchona:

Preparation:
- Harvest bark from Cinchona tree (reddish inner bark)
- Dry bark completely
- Grind to powder
- Boil 1 tablespoon powder in 1 cup water for 10 minutes
- Strain thoroughly
- Drink 3 times per day for malaria treatment
- Extremely bitter (historically mixed with sugar and carbonated water, creating tonic water)

**WARNING**: Overdose causes cinchonism (ringing in ears, headache, nausea, vision disturbance). If these symptoms appear, reduce dose. Severe overdose can cause heart problems and death.

Quinine is also used for severe leg cramps (small doses).

### Morphine from Poppies (Pain Control)

**EXTREME WARNING**: Opium and morphine are highly addictive, can cause death from overdose (respiratory depression), and are difficult to dose safely. Use only for severe pain uncontrolled by other means (amputation, severe burns, terminal illness).

Opium poppy identification:
- Large flowers (white, pink, red, or purple)
- Seed pod (round, smooth, 2-3 inches across)
- Blue-green smooth leaves
- Milky sap when cut

Harvest:
- Wait until flowers drop and seed pod is mature (green, full size)
- Make shallow vertical cuts on pod (do not cut through to interior)
- Milky sap oozes out
- Collect sap (turns brown as it dries)
- This is crude opium

Use:
- Dissolve small amount (rice grain size) in water
- Dose for severe pain
- Wait 1 hour before additional dose
- If person becomes sleepy and breathing slows, no more doses
- **Monitor breathing constantly** - respiratory depression is the main danger
- Normal breathing: 12-20 breaths per minute
- **If breathing drops below 8 breaths per minute:** Respiratory failure is imminent
  - Keep person awake (talk to them, walk them around if possible)
  - Stimulation helps maintain breathing
  - Do not let them sleep deeply
  - If breathing stops, begin rescue breathing (mouth-to-mouth)
- If person cannot be awakened, overdose is critical - aggressive stimulation and rescue breathing may be needed

**Addiction note**: Even short-term use (days) can create dependency. Stopping causes withdrawal (extremely unpleasant but not fatal). Weigh pain relief against addiction risk.

**Legal note**: In most jurisdictions, opium production is highly illegal. Post-collapse, laws may not apply, but this knowledge is for survival scenarios only.

### Digitalis from Foxglove (Heart Failure)

**EXTREME WARNING**: Foxglove is highly poisonous. Therapeutic dose and lethal dose are very close. Many deaths have occurred from digitalis. Use only if person has severe heart failure and death is imminent.

Foxglove identification:
- Tall flowering spike
- Bell-shaped flowers (purple, pink, white, or yellow)
- Hairy leaves

Preparation:
- Dry leaves completely
- Powder finely
- Dose: Tiny amount (literally pinch of powder)
- Mix in water and drink

Signs of overdose:
- Nausea and vomiting
- Vision changes (yellow tint, halos around lights)
- Irregular heartbeat
- Confusion

If overdose occurs, no antidote exists without modern medicine. Supportive care only.

Better option: Do not use foxglove unless you have experience and desperate need.

### Ipecac from Ipecacuanha Root (Induce Vomiting)

Use: Poison ingestion (induces vomiting to expel poison)

**WARNING**: Do not induce vomiting if:
- Corrosive substance ingested (acid, lye - will burn twice)
- Petroleum product ingested (aspiration risk)
- Person unconscious or drowsy
- More than 2 hours since ingestion (poison already absorbed)

Preparation:
- Dry and powder ipecacuanha root
- Small dose (1/2 teaspoon) in water
- Vomiting occurs in 15-30 minutes

Alternative: Soapy water or salt water can also induce vomiting but less reliably.

## Section 7: Childbirth Assistance

Childbirth is the most dangerous event in most women's lives in pre-modern societies. Maternal mortality in medieval Europe was 1-2%. In some periods and places, it reached 5%. The leading causes were:
- Hemorrhage (bleeding out)
- Infection (puerperal fever)
- Obstructed labor (baby cannot fit through pelvis)
- Eclampsia (seizures from high blood pressure)

You cannot fix all of these without modern medicine. But you can significantly reduce deaths through cleanliness, basic interventions, and recognition of emergency situations.

### Preparation (Before Labor Begins)

**Supplies to gather:**
- Clean cloths (boiled and dried) - many
- Clean blankets
- Sharp blade (sterilized) for cutting umbilical cord
- String or thread (boiled) for tying umbilical cord
- Large bowl for placenta
- Water (boiled and cooled)
- Soap or ash for washing
- Additional help (at least one other person)

**Prepare the space:**
- Clean the room thoroughly
- Fresh bedding
- Warm (but not hot) environment
- Privacy (reduces stress)
- Light source (candles, oil lamp)

**Prepare yourself:**
- Wash hands thoroughly (scrub for several minutes)
- Trim nails short
- Wear clean clothes
- Tie back hair
- Remove jewelry

### Stages of Labor

**First Stage (Cervix Opening):**
Duration: Hours to days for first birth, shorter for subsequent births

Signs:
- Regular contractions (tightening of abdomen)
- Contractions grow closer together and stronger
- "Bloody show" (blood-tinged mucus discharge)
- Water breaking (gush or trickle of clear fluid)

What to do:
- Keep mother comfortable
- Allow her to move and change positions as desired
- Offer sips of water
- Encourage urination (full bladder slows labor)
- Time contractions (note when they start and how long they last)
- Do NOT perform vaginal exams unless absolutely necessary (introduces infection)

When to worry:
- Thick, dark, or foul-smelling fluid (not normal amniotic fluid)
- Heavy bleeding (more than menstrual period)
- Fever
- Severe continuous pain between contractions
- No progress for many hours with strong contractions

**Second Stage (Pushing and Birth):**
Duration: Minutes to hours

Signs:
- Uncontrollable urge to push
- Intense pressure
- Baby's head visible at vaginal opening

What to do:
- Support mother in position she finds comfortable (squatting, hands and knees, semi-sitting)
- Encourage pushing with contractions, resting between
- As baby's head emerges ("crowning"), support perineum (area between vagina and anus) with gentle pressure using clean cloth
- DO NOT pull on baby
- Let baby emerge slowly (reduces tearing)
- As head emerges, check for cord around neck - if present, gently slip it over head
- Guide shoulders out one at a time (gentle downward pressure for first shoulder, then upward for second)
- Receive baby
- Baby will be slippery - hold carefully

**Immediate newborn care:**
- Suction mouth and nose if full of fluid (use bulb syringe or mouth suction)
- Dry baby vigorously with clean cloth (stimulates breathing)
- Baby should cry within one minute
- Keep baby warm
- Place on mother's chest (skin-to-skin contact)

If baby does not breathe:
- Rub back vigorously
- Flick soles of feet
- Suction mouth and nose again
- If still not breathing, begin rescue breaths (small puffs into nose and mouth - baby's lungs are tiny)

**Third Stage (Placenta Delivery):**
Duration: 5-30 minutes after baby

Signs:
- Renewed contractions
- Gush of blood
- Umbilical cord lengthens
- Placenta visible at vaginal opening

What to do:
- Wait for signs that placenta has separated
- Gentle traction on cord (do NOT pull hard - can tear cord or invert uterus)
- Mother can push to help expel
- Examine placenta - should be complete (one disc, no missing pieces)
- If pieces missing, they remain inside and can cause infection - seek help if possible

**Post-delivery:**
- Massage uterus (through abdomen) to encourage contraction (feels like firm grapefruit below navel)
- This is critical to stop bleeding
- Continue massaging every 15 minutes for first few hours
- If uterus becomes soft and bleeding increases, massage more vigorously
- Mother should attempt to breastfeed (stimulates uterine contraction)

### Umbilical Cord Care

Timing: Wait 3-5 minutes after birth before cutting (allows blood transfer to baby)

Procedure:
- Tie cord tightly in two places (5cm and 7cm from baby's abdomen)
- Cut between the two ties with sterile blade
- Check that no bleeding from baby's side
- Leave cord stump exposed to air (do not bandage)
- Do not apply anything to stump (many traditional practices introduce infection)
- Stump will dry and fall off in 1-2 weeks

Signs of infection:
- Redness spreading from stump
- Foul smell
- Pus
- Fever in baby

If infection occurs, clean with boiled water, apply honey, seek antibiotics if available.

### Complications and Emergencies

**Hemorrhage (Severe Bleeding):**

After delivery, some bleeding is normal. Heavy bleeding is emergency.

Normal: Soaking one pad per hour for first few hours, then decreasing
Emergency: Soaking through pad in 15 minutes, large clots, continuous heavy flow

Response:
- Massage uterus vigorously (this is priority #1)
- Empty bladder (full bladder prevents uterine contraction)
- Encourage breastfeeding
- If uterus remains soft despite massage, may need bimanual compression: One fist inside vagina pushing up, other hand pressing down on abdomen from outside - this compresses uterus
- This is desperate measure but can save life

**Retained Placenta:**

If placenta does not deliver within 1 hour and bleeding is heavy:
- May need manual removal
- Wash hands and arm thoroughly
- Glove if possible
- Follow cord into uterus
- Locate placenta edge
- Gently separate from uterine wall
- Remove
- **High infection risk** - manual removal introduces bacteria into uterus
- **Start antibiotics immediately if available** (penicillin or broad-spectrum)
- Watch obsessively for fever, foul-smelling discharge, abdominal pain (signs of puerperal infection/sepsis - historically a leading cause of maternal death)

**Shoulder Dystocia (Shoulder Stuck):**

Baby's head delivers but shoulders stuck behind pubic bone.

Signs:
- Head emerges but retracts tightly against perineum
- No further progress despite pushing

Response (McRoberts maneuver):
- Pull mother's knees to chest (changes pelvic angle)
- Apply firm downward pressure on baby's head
- Have assistant apply pressure above mother's pubic bone
- This usually frees shoulder
- If not, may need to break baby's collarbone to allow delivery (grim but baby will heal, alternative is death)

**Breech Birth (Baby Bottom or Feet First):**

Much higher risk than head-first birth.

If discovered during labor (feet or bottom appearing instead of head):
- Allow labor to progress naturally
- Do NOT pull on baby
- Baby will deliver up to shoulders on own
- Head may need assistance (rarely gets stuck)
- High risk of umbilical cord compression

If possible, breech baby should trigger attempt to find someone with more experience.

**Obstructed Labor:**

Labor continues many hours without progress. Mother exhausted. Baby may be too large for pelvis or positioned wrong.

This is a situation that historically killed both mother and baby.

Signs:
- Strong contractions for 12+ hours without cervix fully opening
- Cervix fully open but no descent of baby despite hours of pushing
- Mother's pulse rapid and weak
- Reduced or absent fetal movement
- Swelling of vulva

Without surgical capability (cesarean section), options are limited:
- Change positions frequently
- Squat (opens pelvis)
- Hands and knees (helps baby rotate)
- Rest if possible (exhaustion worsens outcomes)

Grim reality: If baby is dead but cannot deliver, it may need to be reduced in size to save mother's life. This involves destructive procedures that are horrific but necessary. If you face this situation, you are in territory where even modern medicine struggles. Do what you must to save the mother.

### Post-Partum Care

**Mother:**
- Watch for fever (infection)
- Watch for heavy bleeding
- Watch for breast infection (redness, pain, fever)
- Ensure adequate food and water
- Ensure rest
- Check uterus daily (should shrink progressively)
- Watch for signs of depression (very common, usually resolves, but can be severe)

**Baby:**
- Ensure feeding (breastfeeding strongly preferred)
- Watch for jaundice (yellowing skin) - common and usually harmless but can be severe
- Watch for infection (fever, poor feeding, lethargy)
- Keep warm (babies lose heat rapidly)
- Keep clean (but not excessively bathed)

### Breastfeeding Support

Breast milk is perfect food for baby. Formula is inferior and dangerous without clean water and sterilization.

Common problems:
- Difficulty latching: Position baby with nose to nipple, allow rooting reflex
- Sore nipples: Ensure proper latch (whole areola in mouth, not just nipple)
- Insufficient milk: Almost never true - nurse more frequently, supply will increase
- Engorgement: Painful swelling - nurse frequently, apply warm compresses before nursing, cold after

If mother cannot breastfeed (death, severe illness):
- Wet nurse (another nursing mother) is best option
- Animal milk must be boiled and diluted (goat milk is closest to human milk)
- Baby will be at higher risk but can survive

## Section 8: Dental Care

Dental infections kill. An abscessed tooth can spread infection to jaw, then to blood, then to brain or heart. Death from tooth infection was common historically and will be again without intervention.

### Prevention (Critical Because Treatment is Difficult)

**Basic Hygiene:**
- Rinse mouth after eating
- Use frayed stick as toothbrush (chew end of twig until it frays - willow and oak are good choices)
- "Toothpaste": Crushed charcoal, salt, or baking soda
- Brush or scrub teeth daily
- Use thread or thin cord to clean between teeth (flossing)

**Dietary Prevention:**
- Limit sugar (feeds bacteria that create acid that dissolves enamel)
- Eat fibrous foods (natural scrubbing)
- Chew tough foods (stimulates jaw and gums)

**Fluoride:**
If you have access to fluoride (from minerals or salvaged sources), very dilute fluoride rinse strengthens enamel. But fluoride is toxic in higher doses - use extreme caution.

### Toothache Assessment

Toothache means something is wrong:
- Cavity (hole in tooth)
- Abscess (infection at root)
- Cracked tooth
- Gum infection

**Temporary pain relief:**
- Clove oil (contains eugenol, natural anesthetic and antibacterial)
- Apply directly to tooth
- Can also use crushed clove
- Willow bark tea (pain relief)
- Poppy extract if pain is severe (see warnings in Section 6)

**Abscess identification:**
- Severe throbbing pain
- Swelling of gum or face
- Fever
- Foul taste in mouth
- Pus

### Abscess Treatment

An abscess must be drained or it will kill.

**If abscess is visible on gum:**
- Sterilize sharp blade
- Lance (cut open) abscess at point of maximum swelling
- Express pus
- Rinse with salt water
- Apply honey or garlic (antibacterial)
- Rinse multiple times daily until healed

**If tooth is source:**
Ultimately the tooth must come out (see extraction below).
If you have antibiotics, start immediately.
If not, garlic and salt water rinses may help but infection may continue.

### Tooth Extraction

This is difficult, painful, and risky, but sometimes necessary.

**Indications for extraction:**
- Abscess at tooth root not responding to drainage
- Severely broken tooth with exposed nerve
- Tooth so decayed it cannot be saved
- Overcrowding (rare need in survival scenario)

**Tools:**
- Pliers (cleaned and sterilized)
- Lever (sturdy thin blade or purpose-made elevator)
- Strong hands
- Assistant to hold patient's head

**Procedure:**
1. Patient should consume poppy/opium if available for pain (see warnings)
2. Alcohol may help patient tolerate pain but also increases bleeding
3. Sterilize tools
4. Use lever to loosen tooth (work around all sides)
5. Grip tooth with pliers at gum line
6. Rock tooth back and forth (loosening further)
7. Pull firmly and steadily (not jerking)
8. Tooth should release
9. If tooth breaks, remaining root must be removed (difficult)
10. Pack socket with clean cloth
11. Patient bites down on cloth to control bleeding
12. Bleeding should stop in 30-60 minutes

**Post-extraction:**
- Rinse with salt water
- Do not spit or use straws (dislodges clot)
- Soft foods only
- Watch for infection (fever, severe pain, pus, foul smell)
- Socket will heal in weeks

**Complications:**
- Broken tooth (roots remain) - may need surgical removal
- Damage to adjacent teeth - work carefully
- Infection - use antibiotics if available
- Dry socket (clot dislodges, leaving exposed bone) - very painful, pack with clove oil on cloth

### Trench Mouth (Acute Necrotizing Ulcerative Gingivitis)

Trench mouth is a severe gum infection common in stressed populations with poor nutrition and hygiene. Named for its prevalence in WWI trenches. Post-collapse, expect to see this frequently.

**Causes:**
- Poor oral hygiene
- Malnutrition (especially vitamin C deficiency)
- Stress
- Weakened immune system
- Smoking (if tobacco available)

**Symptoms:**
- **Sudden onset** of painful, bleeding gums
- **Grayish film** on gums
- **Crater-like ulcers** between teeth
- **Foul breath** (very distinctive, metallic smell)
- Fever
- Swollen lymph nodes in neck
- Difficulty eating

**Treatment:**

1. **Oral hygiene (critical):**
   - Rinse mouth with warm salt water (1 teaspoon salt per cup water)
   - Rinse 4-6 times per day, especially after eating
   - Gently brush teeth (painful but necessary)
   - Remove dead tissue gently with clean cloth

2. **Nutrition:**
   - Increase vitamin C (citrus fruits, pine needle tea, fresh vegetables)
   - High-protein foods if available
   - Soft foods while painful

3. **Rest:**
   - Stress reduction helps healing
   - Adequate sleep

4. **Antibiotics if available:**
   - Penicillin effective for trench mouth
   - Not always necessary if caught early and treated with hygiene/nutrition

**Without treatment:**
- Can progress to bone destruction
- Tooth loss
- Spread to cheeks and throat
- Systemic infection possible

**Prevention:**
- Maintain oral hygiene even under stress
- Adequate nutrition (vitamin C especially)
- Clean drinking water
- Manage stress where possible

**Prognosis:**
- With treatment (even just salt rinses + nutrition), improvement in days
- Complete healing in 1-2 weeks
- Can recur if conditions don't improve

This is a "disease of desperation" - it appears when people are stressed, malnourished, and cannot maintain hygiene. Post-collapse, it will be common until conditions stabilize.

### Filling Cavities (Advanced, Low Priority)

Small cavities can be filled to prevent progression.

Historical filling materials:
- Beeswax (temporary)
- Tree resin (somewhat longer lasting)
- Lead (effective but toxic - not recommended)
- Gold or silver if available (hammered into cavity)

Procedure:
- Clean cavity thoroughly
- Dry completely
- Pack filling material firmly
- Shape to avoid high spots (should not hit when biting)

This is low priority compared to extraction of abscessed teeth and prevention of new cavities.

## Section 9: Common Diseases and Treatment

### Diarrheal Diseases (Leading Killer)

Causes: Cholera, dysentery, food poisoning, many viruses

The primary danger is dehydration.

**Oral Rehydration Therapy (ORT) - The Most Important Treatment in This Chapter:**

ORT saves lives. It is simple. It requires no advanced technology.

Recipe:
- 1 liter clean water
- 6 teaspoons sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- Mix thoroughly

Dosing:
- Adult: Drink 3-4 liters per day, or match fluid losses
- Child: Small frequent sips constantly
- Baby: Teaspoon every few minutes

Signs ORT is working:
- Urination continues (yellow urine)
- Patient remains alert
- Tears present when crying
- Mouth remains moist

Signs of dehydration:
- No urination for 6+ hours
- Dark urine
- Dry mouth
- Sunken eyes
- Lethargy
- In babies: Sunken soft spot on head

**If severe dehydration:**
ORT may not be absorbed from gut. Person needs intravenous fluids. Without medical care, mortality is high. Continue ORT, keep person comfortable.

**Dysentery treatment (bloody diarrhea):**
- ORT
- Antibiotics if available (ciprofloxacin or similar)
- Garlic (may help)
- Absolutely avoid anti-diarrheal medications (trap bacteria in intestine)

**Cholera:**
- Massive fluid losses (can be liters per hour)
- "Rice water" stools (watery with white flecks)
- Requires huge amounts of ORT
- Antibiotics help but ORT is primary treatment
- 50% mortality without treatment, <1% with proper ORT

### Respiratory Infections

**Pneumonia:**
Infection of lungs. Can be bacterial or viral.

Signs:
- Fever
- Cough (may be productive with yellow/green sputum)
- Difficulty breathing
- Chest pain when breathing
- Rapid breathing

Treatment:
- Rest
- Fluids
- If bacterial (thick colored sputum, high fever), antibiotics
- Penicillin works for some pneumonias
- Steam inhalation can help breathing (boil water, patient breathes steam - careful not to burn)

**Tuberculosis (TB):**
Chronic lung infection. Spreads through air (coughing).

Signs:
- Persistent cough (weeks to months)
- Coughing blood
- Fever (especially night sweats)
- Weight loss
- Weakness

Treatment:
- TB requires multiple antibiotics for months
- Without modern medicine, mortality is high
- Quarantine is essential (highly contagious)
- Good nutrition helps some people fight it off
- Fresh air and sunlight were historical "treatments" (modest benefit)

**Common Cold/Flu:**
Viral. No cure.

Treatment:
- Rest
- Fluids
- Fever control (willow bark tea)
- Steam for congestion
- Chicken soup (actually does help - hot liquid, salt, easy nutrition)

### Malaria (If in Endemic Area)

Spread by mosquitos. Major killer historically in tropical and subtropical regions.

Signs:
- Cyclical fever (spike every 2-3 days)
- Chills and sweats
- Headache
- Nausea

Prevention:
- Eliminate standing water (mosquito breeding)
- Mosquito nets while sleeping
- Cover skin at dawn/dusk (peak mosquito times)

Treatment:
- Quinine (see Section 6)
- Without treatment, mortality varies by type (5-25%)
- Survivors often have recurring episodes

### Parasitic Worms

Extremely common in poor sanitation conditions.

**Roundworms:**
- Transmitted through contaminated food/water
- Cause malnutrition, intestinal blockage
- Treatment: Pumpkin seeds (mildly effective), tobacco (toxic but works), modern dewormers if available

**Tapeworms:**
- From undercooked meat
- Can grow very long in intestine
- Treatment: Pumpkin seeds, pomegranate bark

**Hookworms:**
- Enter through bare feet in contaminated soil
- Cause severe anemia
- Prevention: Wear shoes, improve sanitation
- Treatment: Modern dewormers

**Pinworms:**
- Cause anal itching (especially at night)
- Highly contagious
- Treatment: Garlic, pumpkin seeds (modest effect), modern dewormers far better

Prevention for all:
- Proper sanitation
- Hand washing
- Cook meat thoroughly
- Wear shoes
- Regular deworming (treat entire community)

### Skin Infections

**Cellulitis:**
Bacterial infection of skin and underlying tissue.

Signs:
- Red, hot, swollen area
- Spreads progressively
- Fever
- Pain

Treatment:
- Clean wound if present
- Hot compresses
- Elevation
- Antibiotics essential (can become life-threatening)

**Abscesses:**
See wound care section.

**Fungal Infections:**
- Athlete's foot, ringworm, etc.
- Keep area clean and dry
- Sunlight helps
- Garlic (antifungal)
- Honey (antifungal)

### Scabies and Lice

Parasites that live on skin.

**Scabies:**
- Intense itching (worse at night)
- Tiny burrows visible in skin
- Highly contagious

Treatment:
- Sulfur ointment (make from sulfur and lard/oil)
- Apply to entire body
- Leave on overnight
- Wash off
- Repeat in one week
- Wash all bedding and clothes

**Lice:**
- Itching on scalp or body
- Visible insects or eggs (nits)

Treatment:
- Fine-toothed comb (removes lice and nits)
- Vinegar rinse (helps loosen nits)
- Wash all bedding and clothes in very hot water
- Dry in sun

## Section 10: Medical Tool Making

### Scalpels

Need: Extremely sharp blade for cutting tissue.

Materials: Any hard metal that can hold edge (stainless steel best, regular steel acceptable, brass too soft).

Salvage sources:
- Razor blades (ideal)
- Knife blades
- Saw blades (can be cut and shaped)
- Scissors (can be sharpened to fine point)

Making scalpel:
1. If starting from larger metal, cut to size (10-15cm long, 1cm wide)
2. Grind one end to sharp point
3. Sharpen edge to razor sharpness
4. Other end is handle (wrap with cloth or cord for grip)
5. Sterilize before each use (boil or flame)

### Needles (Suturing)

Need: Sharp needle that can pierce skin, with eye for thread.

Materials: Steel wire, bone, thorn (thorn has no eye, thread ties to base).

Making metal needle:
1. Straighten steel wire
2. Grind point on one end
3. Flatten other end slightly
4. Drill or punch hole for eye (this is hardest part - heat helps)
5. Smooth all rough edges
6. Curve slightly (curved needle is easier to use)

Historical alternative: Large thorn with thread tied to base.

### Forceps

Need: Tool to grasp and hold tissue or foreign objects.

Materials: Two pieces of metal hinged together.

Making forceps:
1. Find or cut two identical metal strips (15cm long, 1cm wide)
2. Create pivot point at center (rivet, bolt, or bind tightly with wire)
3. Shape ends to desired function:
   - Fine tips for precision work
   - Broad tips for clamping
   - Teeth for better grip
4. Test that they meet evenly
5. May need spring mechanism to hold open (difficult to create)

Alternative: Modify pliers or existing tools.

### Bone Saws

Need: Saw that can cut bone cleanly.

Materials: Serrated metal blade.

Salvage: Hack saw blades work well.

Making:
1. If creating from metal stock, cut teeth with file (slow process)
2. Teeth should be small and uniform
3. Set teeth (bend alternating teeth slightly outward) - creates wider cut than blade, prevents binding
4. Attach to handle

### Retractors

Need: Hold wound open for visibility.

Materials: Bent metal strips.

Making:
1. Cut metal strip
2. Bend to desired shape (usually L-shaped or C-shaped)
3. Smooth all edges
4. Dull rather than sharp (should hold tissue without cutting)

Alternative: Use spoons or similar utensils (sterilized).

### Syringes

Need: Inject medications or withdraw fluids.

Materials: Hollow tube with plunger.

This is difficult to make. Salvage syringes if possible (can be sterilized and reused in survival scenarios, despite modern single-use practice).

Primitive syringe:
- Hollow plant stem (elderberry with pith removed)
- Plunger from smaller stem that fits snugly
- Very low precision, high contamination risk

### Irrigation Bulb

Need: Wash wounds with pressured water.

Materials: Rubber or bladder.

Making:
- Animal bladder (cleaned thoroughly)
- Attach hollow tube (bone, metal, plant stem)
- Fill with liquid
- Squeeze to create pressure stream

Alternative: Plastic bottles with small hole in cap.

## Section 11: Sterilization Techniques

Infection kills. Sterilization prevents infection. This cannot be overemphasized.

### Boiling (Most Accessible)

Process:
- Boil items in water for 20 minutes minimum
- Rolling boil throughout (not just hot water)
- Covers tools, cloth, bandages
- After boiling, remove with clean tongs (not bare hands)
- Store on clean cloth or in covered container
- Items remain sterile only while dry and covered

Limitations:
- Does not kill all spores (but kills most bacteria)
- Cannot boil items that would be damaged (some metals rust)

### Flame Sterilization

Process:
- Hold metal tool in flame until red hot
- Allow to cool (do not quench in potentially contaminated water)
- Use immediately

Advantages:
- Very effective
- Quick
- No equipment needed

Disadvantages:
- Dulls blades
- Cannot be used for cloth or heat-sensitive items
- Easy to burn yourself

### Alcohol Sterilization

Process:
- Wash item with soap and water
- Immerse in alcohol (ethanol, isopropanol) for 10+ minutes
- High concentration required (70% minimum, 90%+ better)
- Allow to air dry (do not wipe with potentially contaminated cloth)

Advantages:
- Does not damage tools
- Works for items that cannot be boiled

Disadvantages:
- Requires alcohol (precious resource)
- Does not kill all spores
- Less reliable than heat

### Steam Sterilization (Autoclave)

This is advanced but achievable.

Principle: Steam under pressure reaches higher temperature than boiling water, killing all organisms including spores.

Making primitive autoclave:
- Pressure vessel (thick metal pot with tight lid)
- Can seal lid (weight on top or clamp)
- Heat source
- Pressure release (small hole with plug - prevents explosion)

Process:
- Place items in pot with small amount of water
- Seal lid
- Heat until steam escapes from pressure release
- Plug pressure release
- Continue heating for 20 minutes
- Let cool and depressurize before opening

**DANGER**: Pressurized steam can explode. Must have pressure release. Many people have died from exploding pressure vessels.

Only attempt if you understand pressure vessel safety.

### Chemical Sterilization (Bleach)

Process:
- Prepare bleach solution (1 part bleach to 10 parts water)
- Immerse items for 10 minutes
- Rinse thoroughly with sterile water
- Allow to dry

Effective but leaves chemical residue. Rinse thoroughly.

### UV Sterilization (Sunlight)

Process:
- Lay items in direct sunlight
- Leave for 6+ hours
- Turn to expose all surfaces

This is weakest sterilization method. Better than nothing, worse than all others.

### Storage of Sterile Items

Sterile items become contaminated quickly if exposed.

Storage:
- Wrap in sterile cloth
- Store in covered containers
- Keep dry
- Do not touch with bare hands
- Resterilize if contamination suspected

## Section 12: Record Keeping

In a world without established medical knowledge, you must become a scientist. Record everything. Learn from every case.

### What to Record

**For treatments:**
- Patient description (age, sex, general health)
- Symptoms (detailed)
- Diagnosis (your best guess)
- Treatment given (specific - doses, frequency, duration)
- Outcome (recovery, no change, death)
- Time course (how long until improvement or decline)
- Side effects or complications

**For remedies:**
- Plant identification (detailed description, location found, time of year)
- Part used (leaf, root, bark, flower)
- Preparation method (exact steps)
- Dose given
- Result

**For procedures:**
- Type of procedure
- Patient condition before and after
- Complications
- What worked well
- What would you do differently

### Why Record Keeping Matters

Without records, you will:
- Repeat mistakes
- Forget what worked
- Cannot teach others
- Cannot improve

With records, you:
- Build database of what works in your environment
- Can track disease patterns
- Can identify contamination sources
- Can teach next generation
- Can refine techniques

### Format

Keep it simple. Consistency matters more than perfection.

Example entry:
```
Date: 15th day after first snow
Patient: Adult male, approximately 30 years, previously healthy
Symptoms: Fever (hot to touch), cough with yellow sputum, difficulty breathing, pain in chest
Diagnosis: Pneumonia (suspected bacterial)
Treatment: Penicillin extract (from 14-day culture), dose equivalent to 2 bread slices of culture, given 4 times per day for 7 days. Willow bark tea for fever.
Outcome: Fever broke on day 3. Cough improved by day 5. Full recovery by day 10.
Notes: Patient had no allergic reaction. This strain of penicillin seems effective for pneumonia.
```

### Community Health Records

Track patterns:
- Disease outbreaks (when, what, how many affected)
- Deaths (cause, age, pattern)
- Births (outcomes, complications)
- Water source issues (when wells became contaminated)
- Seasonal patterns (dysentery in summer, pneumonia in winter)

This information reveals:
- Contamination sources
- Disease spread patterns
- Prevention opportunities

## Section 13: Medical Emergency Triage - Allocating Scarce Resources

When multiple people are injured simultaneously (accident, building collapse, conflict, natural disaster), you cannot treat everyone at once. Triage helps allocate limited medical resources to save the most lives.

**The Triage System (Four Categories):**

### Category 1: IMMEDIATE (Red)

**Definition**: Will die without immediate treatment, but good prognosis with treatment.

**Examples:**
- Severe bleeding from major artery (controllable with tourniquet/pressure)
- Sucking chest wound (can be sealed)
- Airway obstruction (can be cleared)
- Severe shock (early stage, responsive to positioning/fluids)
- Compound fracture with arterial bleeding

**Action**: Treat first. These patients can be saved if you act now.

**Time window**: Minutes to an hour before death.

### Category 2: DELAYED (Yellow)

**Definition**: Serious injuries that can wait hours for treatment without dying.

**Examples:**
- Simple fractures (painful but not life-threatening)
- Minor bleeding (controlled with direct pressure)
- Burns <20% body surface area
- Most soft tissue injuries
- Stable head injuries (conscious, no active bleeding)

**Action**: Stabilize (splint fractures, bandage wounds), then move to treatment when Immediate category is handled.

**Time window**: Hours to days before critical.

### Category 3: MINOR (Green) - "Walking Wounded"

**Definition**: Minor injuries that don't require immediate medical care.

**Examples:**
- Superficial cuts and scratches
- Minor burns
- Sprains
- Bruises
- Minor pain

**Action**: Self-care or delayed treatment. Can often help treat others.

**Time window**: Days to weeks - will heal with minimal intervention.

### Category 4: EXPECTANT (Black)

**Definition**: Will likely die regardless of treatment. In mass casualty with limited resources, treatment would waste resources that could save others.

**This is the hardest category. You are choosing to let someone die so others can live.**

**Examples:**
- Massive head trauma with brain matter exposed
- Severe burns >60% body surface area (without modern burn unit)
- Catastrophic internal injuries
- Respiratory failure without ventilator equipment
- Cardiac arrest (in mass casualty, CPR ties up providers for one person with low survival chance)
- Severe radiation exposure (if applicable)

**Action**: Make comfortable. Pain relief if available. Someone should stay with them if possible, but treatment resources go to salvageable patients.

**Ethical reality**: This category exists because treating a patient with 5% survival chance means NOT treating three patients with 80% survival chance. In triage, you maximize lives saved, not effort per patient.

### Triage Process:

**Initial Rapid Assessment (30 seconds per patient):**

1. **Can they walk?**
   - Yes → Minor (Green)
   - No → Continue assessment

2. **Are they breathing?**
   - No → Open airway. If still not breathing after airway opened → Expectant (Black)
   - Yes → Continue

3. **Respiratory rate?**
   - <10 or >29 breaths per minute → Immediate (Red)
   - 10-29 breaths/minute → Continue

4. **Perfusion (circulation)?**
   - Radial pulse absent or capillary refill >2 seconds → Immediate (Red)
   - Pulse present and cap refill <2 seconds → Continue

5. **Mental status?**
   - Cannot follow simple commands → Immediate (Red)
   - Can follow commands → Delayed (Yellow)

**Reassess regularly** - patient status changes. Someone who was Delayed can deteriorate to Immediate.

### Triage Marking:

Mark patients visibly:
- **Red cloth/tag**: Immediate
- **Yellow cloth/tag**: Delayed
- **Green cloth/tag**: Minor
- **Black cloth/tag**: Expectant

Place marker where visible (tie to wrist, pin to clothing).

### Mass Casualty Principles:

**"The greatest good for the greatest number"**

- Spend 5 minutes saving 3 people rather than 30 minutes on 1 person with poor prognosis
- One trained medical person treating Expectant patient = several Immediate patients dying untreated
- Delayed patients may deteriorate if you spend all resources on one Immediate patient
- This is utilitarian ethics: maximize lives saved

**Psychological Burden:**

Triage decisions are traumatic for providers. You will feel like you are abandoning people. You are. But you are saving more lives overall. This is morally correct even though it feels terrible.

**Support for decision-makers:**
- Rotate triage duty (don't burden one person repeatedly)
- Debrief after event (talk through decisions)
- Understand that this is necessary, not cruel
- Remember: In normal circumstances, every patient gets full care. Triage only applies when resources cannot cover everyone.

### When to Stop Triaging and Start Treating:

- When all patients have been assessed
- When Immediate patients are stabilized and you have capacity for Delayed
- When reinforcements arrive and resources increase

### Special Triage Considerations:

**Children**: Same triage categories apply, but children deteriorate faster. Monitor closely.

**Pregnant women**: Two patients (mother and fetus). Prioritize based on mother's condition.

**Medical personnel**: If injured medical personnel can return to service with quick treatment, they may be prioritized to increase overall treatment capacity. (Controversial but pragmatic - one doctor saved = many patients saved.)

## Section 14: What Can't Be Fixed - Setting Realistic Expectations

Honesty matters. Some conditions are untreatable without modern medicine. Recognizing this prevents wasting resources and allows people to make peace with inevitable death.

**Conditions with Very High Mortality Without Modern Medicine:**

### Acute Surgical Emergencies

**Appendicitis**:
- Appendix becomes inflamed, then ruptures
- Symptoms: Right lower abdominal pain, fever, nausea, tenderness at McBurney's point (1/3 distance from hip bone to navel)
- **Without surgery**: Rupture → peritonitis → death in days
- **With crude surgery**: Possible survival but very high infection risk (opening abdomen without sterile technique = peritonitis)
- **Reality**: Most post-collapse appendicitis cases will be fatal
- **What you can do**: Antibiotics may delay rupture but rarely cure. Keep patient comfortable. Some historical cases resolved spontaneously but very rare.

**Internal Bleeding**:
- From trauma, ruptured organs, ectopic pregnancy
- Symptoms: Shock without external bleeding, abdominal distension, pain
- **Without surgery**: Bleeds out, dies
- **With crude surgery**: Finding bleeding source in abdomen without proper lighting/tools = near impossible
- **Reality**: Most cases fatal
- **What you can do**: Treat shock (position, fluids), make comfortable, hope bleeding stops spontaneously (sometimes happens with small bleeds)

**Bowel Obstruction** (Complete):
- Intestine blocked by tumor, scar tissue, hernia
- Symptoms: Severe abdominal pain, vomiting (eventually fecal), no bowel movements, distended abdomen
- **Without surgery**: Death in days from perforation/sepsis or dehydration
- **Reality**: High mortality without surgical intervention
- **What you can do**: Keep comfortable, IV fluids if possible (extends survival), some obstructions resolve spontaneously

### Cardiac Conditions

**Heart Attack** (Myocardial Infarction):
- Blood clot blocks coronary artery
- Symptoms: Severe chest pain (crushing, radiating to arm/jaw), shortness of breath, sweating, nausea
- **Without modern care**: 30-40% mortality in first hours
- **Reality**: Survivors depend on which artery blocked and extent of damage. No treatment available post-collapse.
- **What you can do**: Rest, aspirin (if available - thins blood slightly), manage pain, hope for best

**Heart Failure** (Severe):
- Heart unable to pump effectively
- Symptoms: Severe shortness of breath, fluid in lungs, swelling in legs
- **Without medication**: Progressive worsening, death from fluid in lungs or heart stopping
- **Reality**: Quality of life and lifespan severely limited
- **What you can do**: Reduce salt intake, elevate head while sleeping, limit physical activity, digitalis (see Section 6 - very dangerous)

### Stroke

- Blood clot or bleed in brain
- Symptoms: Sudden weakness/numbness on one side, difficulty speaking, severe headache, vision problems
- **Without modern care**: Depends on type and location
  - Small strokes: May recover partially
  - Large strokes: Death or severe disability
  - Hemorrhagic stroke (bleeding): Very high mortality
- **What you can do**: Rest, prevent complications (pneumonia from immobility, bedsores), physical therapy for survivors, manage blood pressure if possible (rest, reduce stress)

### Cancer

**Advanced Cancer** (Any Type):
- **Without surgery/chemotherapy/radiation**: Progressive growth, metastasis, death
- **Timeline**: Months to years depending on cancer type
- **What you can do**:
  - Pain management (opiates if available)
  - Nutrition support
  - Comfort care
  - Emotional support
  - Some cancers grow slowly (years), others rapidly (months)
  - Quality of life focus, not cure

### Metabolic/Endocrine Diseases

**Type 1 Diabetes** (Severe):
- Pancreas produces no insulin
- **Without insulin**: Death in days to weeks from diabetic ketoacidosis
- **Reality**: Insulin production requires pharmaceutical industry. Animal insulin extraction is possible but very difficult (see note below)
- **What you can do**: Very low carbohydrate diet extends survival but not indefinitely

**NOTE on Insulin Production**: Insulin can be extracted from animal pancreases (pigs, cattle). This requires:
- Fresh pancreases from slaughtered animals
- Acid/alcohol extraction
- Purification (complex)
- Dosing (difficult without measurement)
- This is Tier 2-3 technology, achievable but beyond immediate post-collapse capability
- If you have diabetics in community, prioritize this research

**Kidney Failure** (Advanced):
- Kidneys cannot filter blood
- Symptoms: Swelling, fatigue, nausea, confusion, eventually coma
- **Without dialysis**: Death in days to weeks from toxin buildup
- **Reality**: Dialysis requires complex equipment. Not achievable post-collapse.
- **What you can do**: Very low protein diet slightly extends survival. Keep comfortable.

### Infectious Diseases Without Available Treatment

**Rabies** (After Symptoms Appear):
- Virus from animal bite
- Symptoms: Fever, anxiety, confusion, hydrophobia (fear of water), paralysis
- **Without modern vaccine/immunoglobulin**: 100% fatal once symptoms appear
- **What you can do**: Prevent (kill/quarantine any animal that bites someone). If symptoms appear, make comfortable. Death is certain and terrible.

**Advanced Tuberculosis** (Without Antibiotics):
- **With antibiotics**: Curable
- **Without antibiotics**: ~50% mortality, survivors often permanently damaged
- **What you can do**: Quarantine, good nutrition, rest, fresh air, sunlight (historical sanatorium treatment - modest benefit)

**HIV/AIDS** (Without Antiretrovirals):
- Virus destroys immune system
- **Without modern drugs**: Death in ~10 years from opportunistic infections
- **What you can do**: Treat opportunistic infections as they arise, nutrition, prevent transmission

### Trauma

**Severe Head Trauma**:
- Brain injury, skull fracture with brain damage
- **Without neurosurgery**: Depends on severity
- Many will die, some survive with disability
- **What you can do**: Keep still, elevate head slightly, monitor, manage seizures, hope

**Spinal Cord Injury** (Complete):
- Paralysis from broken back/neck
- **Immediate mortality**: Low if breathing unaffected
- **Long-term mortality**: High from complications (pneumonia, bedsores, urinary infections)
- **What you can do**: Prevent movement (paralysis permanent, but movement can worsen), prevent bedsores (turn frequently), catheterize bladder, treat infections aggressively, physical therapy for whatever movement remains

### The Honest Conversation

When someone has an untreatable condition:

1. **Tell them honestly**: "This condition requires treatment we don't have. I'm sorry."
2. **Explain what will happen**: Timeline, symptoms they'll experience
3. **Offer what you can**: Pain management, comfort, presence
4. **Allow time for preparation**: Goodbyes, settling affairs, emotional preparation
5. **Don't give false hope**: Kindness is honesty, not false optimism

**This is hard. It's supposed to be hard. But it's necessary.**

Some deaths cannot be prevented post-collapse. Accepting this allows proper allocation of resources to salvageable patients and dignified end-of-life care for those who cannot be saved.

## Final Thoughts

Medicine in a post-collapse world will be brutal. People will die from things that modern medicine cures easily. Children will die. Women will die in childbirth. Infections that antibiotics would cure in days will kill in weeks.

But with the knowledge in this chapter, you can prevent many deaths. You can reduce suffering. You can give people a fighting chance.

The most important things are the simplest:
- Clean water
- Proper sanitation
- Hand washing
- Wound cleaning
- Basic nutrition

These unglamorous practices will save more lives than any dramatic surgery or exotic remedy.

When you must do more - when someone needs surgery, or has severe infection, or requires medication - do it carefully. Remember that you can harm as well as help. Move deliberately. Keep things clean. Record what happens.

And remember this above all: In the absence of modern medicine, prevention is everything. An ounce of prevention truly is worth a pound of cure - perhaps more so than in any other field.

Build your medical capability slowly and carefully. Make safety your priority. Learn from both successes and failures. Teach others so knowledge spreads.

Medicine may be the most important technology you rebuild. Lives depend on getting it right.

**SAFETY SUMMARY:**

This chapter contains information on medical procedures and remedies that can cause harm or death if done incorrectly. Key safety principles:

1. Clean technique prevents infection - this cannot be overemphasized
2. First do no harm - if unsure, do less rather than more
3. Dose matters - too little is ineffective, too much is poison
4. Allergic reactions can be fatal - test first when possible
5. Record everything - learn from both successes and failures
6. Teach properly - incorrect knowledge passed on multiplies danger
7. Know your limits - some situations have no good solution with Tier 1 technology

The goal is not to replace modern medicine. The goal is to preserve life when modern medicine is not available.

Stay safe. Stay clean. Stay humble. And may you never need to use most of what is written here.
