# Textiles

## Why This Matters

Clothing wears out faster than you think. A typical shirt worn daily will last 6-12 months before becoming unwearable. Work pants subjected to manual labor might fail in 3-6 months. In a post-collapse scenario, your existing clothing stockpile will be depleted within 2-3 years at most. Winter deaths from exposure will follow if you cannot produce textiles.

Textile production is deceptively complex. Modern clothing comes from an industrial chain involving agriculture, chemical processing, and precision machinery. Replicating this with hand tools requires significant labor and specialized knowledge. A single community of 100 people needs approximately 5-8 dedicated textile workers to maintain basic clothing supplies, assuming agricultural fiber production is already established.

This is Tier 1 technology because you cannot wait. Start learning these skills while salvaged clothing still exists to supplement your production.

## Fiber Production

### Cotton

Cotton produces the softest, most versatile plant fiber, but requires specific climate conditions.

**Growing Requirements:**
- Climate: 180-200 frost-free days, consistent moisture during growth
- Temperature: Daytime 70-100°F, nighttime above 60°F
- Soil: Well-drained, pH 5.8-8.0
- Spacing: 3-4 inches between plants, 36-40 inches between rows

**Varieties:**
- Upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum): Most common, shorter staple (3/4 to 1-1/4 inch)
- Sea Island/Egyptian (G. barbadense): Longer staple (1-1/2 to 2 inches), finer yarn, requires warmer climate

**Planting:**
Plant seeds 1/2 to 1 inch deep after last frost when soil temperature reaches 60°F. Seeds germinate in 5-10 days. Each plant produces 50-100 bolls over the growing season.

**Harvesting:**
Cotton is ready when bolls split open exposing white fiber, typically 150-180 days after planting. In small-scale production, hand-pick opened bolls every few days over 4-6 weeks. One person can hand-pick 200-300 pounds per day.

**Ginning (Seed Removal):**
Cotton lint must be separated from seeds. Seed cotton weighs about 3 times the final lint weight.

Simple roller gin (for long-staple cotton):
- Two wooden or metal rollers rotating in opposite directions at different speeds
- Feed seed cotton between rollers
- Lint pulls through, seeds fall away
- Process: 1-2 pounds per hour by hand-crank

Churka gin (traditional Indian design):
- Two hardwood rollers (1 inch diameter) set with 1/16 inch gap
- Hand crank turns rollers
- More efficient than simple roller: 3-4 pounds per hour

After ginning, fluff and pick out remaining seed fragments. Store in dry conditions to prevent mildew.

**Yield:**
- 1 acre produces 400-800 pounds of lint cotton (dependent on variety and conditions)
- 1 pound of cotton makes approximately 4 shirts or 2 pairs of pants
- 100 people require roughly 300-400 pounds of cotton fiber annually for basic clothing

### Wool

Wool provides superior insulation, water resistance, and durability. Easier to process than plant fibers in many ways.

**Sheep Breeds:**
- Merino: Finest wool (18-24 microns), 10-15 pounds per shearing
- Romney: Medium wool (31-36 microns), dual-purpose, 8-12 pounds per shearing
- Icelandic: Dual-coat (tog and thel), extremely hardy, 4-7 pounds per shearing
- Churro: Coarse, very hardy in harsh climates, 4-6 pounds per shearing

Choose breeds based on climate and intended use. Fine wool for next-to-skin garments, coarse wool for outerwear and rugs.

**Basic Sheep Care:**
- Grazing: 2-6 sheep per acre depending on pasture quality
- Water: 1-2 gallons per day per sheep
- Shelter: Simple three-sided structure for lambing and extreme weather
- Hoof trimming: Every 6-8 weeks
- Worming: Semi-annually or as needed based on fecal examination

**Shearing:**
Shear in spring after last frost before hot weather. Experienced shearers handle a sheep in 3-5 minutes; beginners need 20-30 minutes.

Equipment:
- Hand shears (traditional): Scissor-action blades, 12-16 inches long
- Sharpening stone for maintaining blade edge

Technique:
1. Tip sheep onto rump, back against your legs
2. Start with belly wool (lowest quality, separate this)
3. Work up sides in continuous passes
4. Keep skin taut, avoid second cuts
5. Fleece should come off in one piece

**Skirting:**
Immediately after shearing, lay fleece out and remove:
- Soiled edges (manure tags)
- Very coarse or very short fiber
- Extremely matted sections

**Washing (Scouring):**
Raw wool contains 30-70% lanolin, dirt, and suint (dried sheep sweat). Must be removed before spinning.

Method:
1. Heat water to 140-160°F (do not boil)
2. Add soap (1 tablespoon per gallon) or wood ash lye solution
3. Immerse wool, let soak 10-15 minutes without agitation
4. Lift out gently, squeeze (don't wring)
5. Repeat with fresh hot water until water runs clear (usually 3-4 baths)
6. Final rinse in cool water
7. Dry on racks or hang in mesh bags, out of direct sunlight

**Yield:**
- Clean wool is typically 60-80% of raw fleece weight
- 4-6 pounds of clean wool needed per person per year for basic clothing
- 100 people require 25-30 sheep flock (shorn annually)

### Flax (Linen)

Linen is stronger than cotton, excellent for warm weather, and grows in cooler climates.

**Growing:**
- Climate: Cool-season crop, 90-100 day growing season
- Soil: Fertile, well-drained, pH 6.0-7.0
- Seeding rate: 50-80 pounds per acre for fiber (plant densely for long, straight stems)
- Height: 2-4 feet at maturity

Plant early spring. Flax requires minimal care but consistent moisture.

**Harvesting:**
Harvest when stems turn yellow and lower leaves drop, usually when 50% of seed bolls are brown. For best fiber, harvest before full seed maturity.

Pull plants (don't cut) to preserve full stem length. Grip handful of stems near base, pull with steady upward motion. Bundle and stand upright to dry for 1-2 weeks.

**Rippling (Seed Removal):**
Pull dried stems through a coarse comb (ripple) to remove seed heads. Save seeds for planting or linseed oil production.

**Retting (Breaking Down Pectin):**
Retting separates fiber from woody core (shives). This is the critical, skill-intensive step.

Dew retting (safest for beginners):
1. Spread flax stems on grass in single layer
2. Turn every few days
3. Morning dew provides moisture, microorganisms break down pectin
4. Duration: 2-6 weeks depending on weather
5. Test: Fiber should separate easily from core when bent
6. Over-retting causes gray, weak fiber; under-retting makes processing difficult

Water retting (faster, riskier):
1. Submerge bundles in pond or tank
2. Weight down to keep submerged
3. Duration: 7-14 days in warm weather
4. Strong bacterial smell indicates progress
5. Test daily after day 5
6. Remove when fiber separates easily
7. Rinse thoroughly and dry

**Breaking:**
Once retted and dried, break woody core away from fiber.

Flax brake:
- Two hinged boards with parallel slats
- Slats on one board fit between slats on other
- Place flax stems across lower board
- Strike with upper board
- Crushing action breaks shives

Work along stem length, moving stems through brake several times.

**Scutching:**
Remove remaining shive fragments by beating fibers over board edge with wooden scutching knife (shaped blade, not sharp). This requires practice to avoid cutting fibers.

**Hackling (Combing):**
Pull fiber through progressively finer combing boards to:
- Remove remaining shive particles
- Separate short fibers (tow) from long fibers (line)
- Align fibers parallel

Hackles: Boards with metal pins set at angles
- Coarse hackle: Pins 1 inch apart
- Medium hackle: Pins 1/2 inch apart
- Fine hackle: Pins 1/4 inch apart

Tow (short fibers) can be spun into coarser yarn for sacks, rope, or work clothing.

**Yield:**
- 1 acre produces 300-500 pounds of retted flax straw
- Processing yields 20-25% fiber by weight (60-125 pounds per acre)
- 100 people require 1-2 acres of flax for supplemental fiber

### Hemp

Hemp processing is similar to flax but produces stronger, coarser fiber excellent for rope, canvas, and durable clothing.

**Growing:**
- Climate: Adaptable, 90-120 day season
- Soil: Similar to flax, tolerates wider pH range (6.0-7.5)
- Seeding: 40-60 pounds per acre for fiber
- Height: 6-12 feet (taller than flax)

**Processing:**
Identical to flax: harvest by pulling, ret (dew or water), break, scutch, hackle. Hemp is more forgiving of over-retting than flax.

**Uses:**
- Rope and cordage (superior strength)
- Canvas and sailcloth
- Sacking and bags
- Coarse clothing (work pants, jackets)
- Paper (from hurds/shives)

**Yield:**
- 1 acre produces 400-700 pounds retted hemp straw
- Processing yields 25-30% fiber (100-210 pounds per acre)

### Salvaged Fiber Recovery

In early post-collapse period, reclaim fiber from damaged textiles.

**Unraveling Machine-Knit Fabric:**
1. Cut fabric into manageable sections
2. Find end of yarn (usually at seam)
3. Pull gently - knit fabric unravels into continuous yarn
4. Wind into loose balls for later use
5. Can be re-knit or woven

**Recovering Fiber from Woven Fabric:**
1. Cut along seams to separate panels
2. Pull out seam threads
3. For loose weaves: pull weft threads individually, collect warp threads
4. For tight weaves: cut into strips, ravel edges, use strips for rag rugs or felt

**Felting Scraps:**
Small wool scraps can be felted into useful fabric:
1. Layer wool scraps (must be wool, not cotton/synthetic)
2. Wet with hot soapy water
3. Agitate/rub vigorously
4. Fibers mat together into cohesive fabric
5. Use for insulation, padding, or simple garments

## Spinning Fiber into Thread and Yarn

Spinning twists loose fibers into continuous, strong thread. The spinning process aligns fibers and the twist holds them together.

### Fiber Preparation

**Carding (for wool and cotton):**
Carding aligns fibers and removes remaining debris.

Hand cards:
- Two paddles with fine wire teeth (bent nails can substitute)
- Size: 4x10 inches typically
- Wire density: 100-200 teeth per square inch

Technique:
1. Place fiber on one card
2. Brush cards against each other at slight angle
3. Fiber transfers between cards and becomes aligned
4. After 5-10 passes, remove fiber as rolag (loose roll)

One pound of fiber requires 2-4 hours of carding.

**Combing (for flax and long-staple fibers):**
Already accomplished during hackling. Fibers should be kept parallel.

### Drop Spindle

Simplest spinning tool. Consists of:
- Shaft: 10-12 inches long, 1/4 to 3/8 inch diameter (wood dowel or straight stick)
- Whorl: Circular weight (2-4 ounces) positioned on lower third of shaft
- Hook or notch at top to catch yarn

**Operation:**
1. Attach leader yarn to shaft below whorl, up through whorl, around hook
2. Hold fiber source (rolag or flax) in one hand
3. Spin drop spindle clockwise with other hand
4. As spindle spins, draw out fibers
5. Twist travels up into fiber, creating yarn
6. When spindle nearly touches ground, wind yarn onto shaft
7. Repeat

Twist direction matters:
- Z-twist (clockwise): Standard for singles
- S-twist (counter-clockwise): For plying or special applications

**Production Rate:**
Beginners: 20-50 yards per hour
Experienced: 80-150 yards per hour

### Spinning Wheel

Dramatically faster than drop spindle. Basic wheel multiplies hand rotation 20-40 times.

**Components:**
1. Drive wheel: 18-24 inch diameter wooden wheel
2. Flyer: U-shaped part that twists fiber and winds onto bobbin simultaneously
3. Bobbin: Spool that holds finished yarn
4. Whorl: Small wheel on flyer shaft
5. Drive band: Cord connecting drive wheel to whorl
6. Treadle: Foot pedal connected to drive wheel
7. Mother-of-all: Frame holding flyer and bobbin assemblies

**Construction Notes:**
- Drive wheel: Can be fabricated from bent wood strips or cut from plank
- Flyer and bobbin: Require basic woodturning skills or careful carving
- Critical ratio: Drive wheel circumference to whorl circumference determines twist rate (typical: 20:1 to 40:1)
- Bearings: Wood-on-wood with tallow lubrication sufficient; leather washers reduce friction

**Operation:**
1. Treadle drives wheel continuously
2. Draft (pull) fibers from supply with both hands
3. Twist enters fiber as it's drawn
4. Flyer winds twisted yarn onto bobbin
5. Move yarn to different hooks on flyer arm to build even bobbin

**Production Rate:**
Experienced spinner: 200-400 yards per hour on wheel

### Yarn Quality Control

**Twist Amount:**
- Under-twisted: Weak, pulls apart easily
- Over-twisted: Yarn kinks and snarls, harsh texture
- Correct: Yarn hangs straight when suspended, shows visible spiral

Test: Suspend 6-inch length with small weight. Should support weight without breaking or excessive stretching.

**Consistency:**
Run yarn through fingers while inspecting. Diameter should be uniform. Thick/thin spots are weak points.

**Plying:**
Combining two or more singles creates stronger, more balanced yarn.

Method:
1. Wind two bobbins of singles (both Z-twist)
2. Spin together in opposite direction (S-twist, counter-clockwise)
3. Twist naturally balances, creating stable yarn
4. 2-ply is standard for most applications

**Setting Twist:**
After spinning/plying, set twist to relax yarn:
1. Immerse in warm water 10-15 minutes
2. Squeeze out water
3. Hang with light weight to dry
4. Stored yarn won't kink or tangle

**Yarn Weight Standards:**
Standardize by wraps per inch (WPI):
- Lace: 20+ WPI
- Fingering: 14-20 WPI
- Sport: 12-14 WPI
- Worsted: 9-12 WPI
- Bulky: 6-9 WPI

Record WPI of successful yarns to replicate for matching projects.

## Weaving

Weaving interlaces perpendicular threads (warp and weft) to create fabric.

### Terminology

- Warp: Threads running lengthwise, under tension
- Weft (or woof): Threads running crosswise, woven through warp
- Selvage: Finished edges where weft turns
- Shed: Opening between warp threads for weft passage
- Reed: Comb that spaces warp threads and beats weft into place
- Heddle: Loop or eye that lifts specific warp threads

### Simple Frame Loom

Easiest to construct, suitable for small projects (scarves, towels, rugs).

**Construction:**
1. Rectangular frame: 2x3 feet (or desired size) from 1x2 inch lumber
2. Corner joints: Half-lap or mortise and tenon
3. Warp bar: Cross-piece at each end with nails or pegs spaced 1/4 to 1/2 inch apart
4. Frame must be rigid and square

**Warping:**
1. Tie warp yarn to first peg on top bar
2. Run down to corresponding peg on bottom bar
3. Return to next peg on top bar
4. Continue until entire width is warped
5. Maintain even tension

**Weaving:**
1. Pick up alternating warp threads with stick (creates shed)
2. Pass weft through shed
3. Beat weft down with fingers or comb
4. Pick up opposite set of warp threads
5. Pass weft back through new shed
6. Continue to desired length

For patterns beyond plain weave, use multiple shed sticks, each lifting different thread combinations.

**Limitations:**
- Width limited by arm span (about 30 inches maximum comfortable)
- Fabric length limited by frame size
- Changing sheds is manual and slow

### Floor Loom

More complex to build, but enables efficient production of quality cloth.

**Basic Floor Loom Components:**

Frame:
- Two uprights: 5-6 feet tall, 4x4 inch posts
- Two cross-beams: Connect tops of uprights
- Base: Stable platform, typically 3x5 feet

Cloth and warp beams:
- Front beam (cloth beam): Finished fabric winds here
- Back beam (warp beam): Holds un-woven warp under tension
- Both: 2-3 inch diameter rollers with ratchet/pawl mechanisms to maintain tension

Harnesses (or shafts):
- Frames that hold heddles
- Minimum 2 for plain weave; 4 for twill and more complex patterns
- Suspended from top frame, can be raised or lowered
- Size: Match loom width

Heddles:
- Individual loops with eyes in center
- Each warp thread passes through one heddle
- Can be made from string, wire, or split reed
- Need 200-400 per harness for typical loom

Treadles:
- Foot pedals, one per desired shed combination
- Connected to harnesses with cords/cables
- Pressing treadle raises/lowers specific harnesses

Reed:
- Metal or reed comb
- Determines threads per inch (thread density)
- Also beats weft into place
- Mounted in beater frame that swings

Shuttle:
- Holds weft thread
- Pointed ends to pass through shed easily
- 12-16 inches long for typical loom

**Basic Operation:**
1. Warp loom (threading warp through heddles and reed - most time-consuming step)
2. Press treadle to open shed
3. Throw shuttle through shed
4. Beat weft with reed
5. Press different treadle for next shed
6. Repeat

Experienced weaver: 3-6 yards per day of plain weave fabric

### Weaving Patterns

**Plain Weave:**
- Simplest: Weft passes over one, under one warp thread
- Treadle pattern: Alternate between two sheds
- Creates balanced, stable fabric
- Examples: Muslin, canvas, tabby

**Twill Weave:**
- Weft passes over one or more warps in diagonal pattern
- Requires 3 or 4 harnesses minimum
- Creates diagonal lines in fabric
- Stronger and more flexible than plain weave
- Examples: Denim, drill cloth, serge

**Basket Weave:**
- Variation of plain weave
- Weft passes over two, under two (or other multiples)
- Creates checkerboard appearance
- More flexible, less stable than plain weave

**Thread Count:**
For practical clothing fabric:
- Coarse: 12-20 threads per inch (work clothes, canvas)
- Medium: 20-40 threads per inch (general clothing)
- Fine: 40-60 threads per inch (shirts, undergarments)

Higher thread count requires finer yarn and more time.

## Knitting

Knitting creates fabric from interlocking loops, resulting in elastic, form-fitting material excellent for cold-weather clothing.

### Basic Knitting Needles

Simple to fabricate:
- Material: Hardwood, bone, or metal wire
- Size: 1/8 to 1/2 inch diameter (larger = looser fabric)
- Length: 10-14 inches for straight needles
- Points: Taper to smooth point, not too sharp
- Finish: Sand/polish smooth to prevent snagging

Circular needles (for seamless tubes):
- Two short needles connected by flexible cord
- For socks, hats, sweater bodies

### Basic Stitches

**Knit Stitch:**
1. Insert right needle through loop on left needle, front to back
2. Wrap yarn around right needle
3. Pull new loop through old loop
4. Slide old loop off left needle

**Purl Stitch:**
1. Insert right needle through loop on left needle, back to front
2. Wrap yarn around right needle
3. Pull new loop through
4. Slide old loop off left needle

**Stockinette Stitch:**
Alternate rows of knit and purl. Creates smooth fabric on one side, bumpy on reverse. Most common for garments.

**Garter Stitch:**
Knit every row. Creates reversible, textured fabric that lies flat.

**Ribbing:**
Alternate knit and purl stitches within same row (K2P2 = knit 2, purl 2). Creates elastic fabric perfect for cuffs and waistbands.

### Gauge

Knitting gauge determines fabric size and drape.

Measure: Number of stitches and rows per 4 inches in your yarn and needle size.

Example: 20 stitches x 28 rows per 4 inches

This information allows you to calculate stitches needed for any size garment.

### Production

Simple sock: 8-12 hours for experienced knitter
Sweater: 40-60 hours

Knitting produces excellent cold-weather garments but is slower than weaving for producing yardage.

## Dyeing

Undyed fabric is serviceable but monotonous. Dyes improve morale and allow identification/organization.

### Natural Dye Sources

**Yellow/Gold:**
- Onion skins: Produces gold to orange-brown (abundant)
- Goldenrod flowers: Bright yellow
- Marigold flowers: Yellow to gold
- Oak bark: Tan to brown

**Red/Pink:**
- Madder root (Rubia tinctorum): Brick red to orange-red (cultivate this)
- Pokeweed berries: Pink to burgundy (not lightfast)
- Bloodroot: Red-orange
- Cochineal insects: Brilliant red (if available - dried female insects)

**Blue:**
- Indigo (Indigofera species): Only reliable natural blue (worth cultivating)
- Woad (Isatis tinctoria): Blue, easier to grow than indigo in temperate climates
- Black walnut hulls: Blue-gray (with iron mordant)

**Purple:**
- Combine red and blue dyes
- Elderberries: Purple (not lightfast)
- Blackberries: Purple-gray

**Brown:**
- Walnut hulls: Rich dark brown (no mordant needed)
- Oak bark: Light brown
- Tea: Tan to brown
- Coffee: Brown

**Green:**
- Overdye yellow with blue
- Nettle: Yellow-green
- Lily of the valley leaves: Green (toxic - handle carefully)

**Black:**
- Oak galls with iron: Dark gray to black
- Logwood (Haematoxylum campechianum): Blue-black (if available)

### Mordants

Mordants bond dye to fiber, improving colorfastness. Essential for most natural dyes.

**Alum (Aluminum Potassium Sulfate):**
- Most common mordant
- Safe, easy to use
- Works on all fibers
- Concentration: 10-15% weight of fiber
- Available from wood ash processing or salvage

**Iron (Ferrous Sulfate):**
- Darkens colors
- Creates grays and blacks
- Concentration: 2-5% weight of fiber
- Source: Rusty nails in vinegar (let sit 1-2 weeks)

**Tannin:**
- From oak galls, sumac, tea
- Used on plant fibers before alum
- Concentration: 8-10% weight of fiber

**Copper (Copper Sulfate):**
- Brightens greens and blues
- Concentration: 2-5% weight of fiber
- Source: Salvage or copper in vinegar

### Dyeing Process

**For Protein Fibers (Wool, Silk):**

1. Clean fiber thoroughly
2. Mordant:
   - Dissolve mordant in warm water
   - Add fiber
   - Heat to 180-200°F
   - Maintain temperature 45-60 minutes
   - Let cool, rinse lightly
3. Dye bath:
   - Extract dye: Simmer plant material in water 1 hour (1:1 plant to water ratio)
   - Strain out plant material
   - Add mordanted fiber to dye bath
   - Heat to 180-200°F
   - Maintain 30-60 minutes
   - Turn off heat, let cool in bath (deeper color)
4. Rinse in progressively cooler water until water runs clear
5. Dry away from direct sunlight

**For Plant Fibers (Cotton, Linen):**

1. Scour well to remove oils
2. Tannin bath (if using alum):
   - Simmer fiber in tannin solution 1 hour
   - Rinse lightly
3. Mordant with alum as above
4. Dye as above (may require longer time for deep color)

**Indigo/Woad (Vat Dyeing - Different Process):**

Indigo is unique - insoluble in water and requires fermentation/reduction to work.

Traditional method:
1. Prepare indigo vat:
   - 1 part indigo (crushed leaves or powder)
   - 2 parts wood ash lye
   - 10 parts water
   - Heat to 120-140°F
2. Add reducing agent (stale urine, wheat bran, or wood ash)
3. Ferment 3-7 days until surface shows copper/purple sheen
4. Dip pre-wetted fiber in vat (fiber emerges yellow-green)
5. Expose to air - color oxidizes to blue
6. Repeat dipping for darker blue (3-6 dips for deep blue)
7. Rinse thoroughly

Indigo requires no mordant and is extremely colorfast.

### Colorfast Testing

Test dyed samples:
- Wash sample in hot soapy water - color should not run significantly
- Expose sample to direct sunlight for 2 weeks - color should not fade noticeably

Adjust mordant or technique if color is not fast.

## Leather Production

Leather provides durable, water-resistant material for boots, belts, harnesses, and protective gear. Essential for long-term survival.

### Hide Preparation

**Fleshing:**
Immediately after skinning animal, remove all meat, fat, and membrane from flesh side.

Tools:
- Fleshing beam: Smooth log or board at 45-degree angle
- Fleshing knife: Dull blade or two-handled drawknife

Technique:
1. Drape hide over beam, fur/hair side down
2. Scrape with knife, working from center toward edges
3. Remove all tissue - remaining fat will cause spoilage

**Salting (Temporary Preservation):**
If not processing immediately:
1. Lay hide flat, flesh side up
2. Cover completely with non-iodized salt (1 pound per pound of hide)
3. Fold flesh-to-flesh
4. Store in cool place
5. Will keep 6-12 months

**Dehairing:**

For smooth leather:
1. Soak hide in lime solution (1 pound hydrated lime per 5 gallons water)
2. Duration: 3-7 days for thin hides, up to 3 weeks for thick hides
3. Hair loosens and can be scraped off
4. Scrape over beam using dull knife
5. Rinse thoroughly to remove all lime

For hair-on hides:
- Skip this step
- Tan with hair intact

### Tanning Methods

Tanning converts raw hide (which will rot) into stable leather (which won't). Multiple methods exist.

**Vegetable Tanning:**

Uses tannins from tree bark. Produces firm, durable leather.

Best bark sources (by tannin content):
- Oak: 8-14% tannin
- Hemlock: 9-13% tannin
- Chestnut: 6-10% tannin
- Sumac leaves: 25-30% tannin (fastest)

Process:
1. Prepare tannin solution:
   - Grind/shred bark
   - Simmer in water 2-3 hours
   - Strain out bark chunks
   - Cool to room temperature
2. Create layering pit:
   - Alternate layers of hide and ground bark in vat
   - Cover with tannin solution
3. Let sit in progressively stronger solutions:
   - Week 1: 3% solution (light tan color)
   - Week 2-4: 5% solution
   - Week 4-12: 8-10% solution
4. Total time: 2-6 months depending on hide thickness
5. Remove, rinse, neutralize with baking soda solution
6. Oil with neatsfoot oil or tallow
7. Dry slowly, work/stretch frequently to keep supple

**Brain Tanning:**

Uses emulsified animal fats. Produces soft, supple leather (buckskin). Faster than vegetable tanning.

Principle: "Every animal has enough brains to tan its own hide" is approximately true.

Process:
1. Flesh and dehair hide (can use wood ash lye instead of lime)
2. Prepare brain solution:
   - One brain (any animal) per hide
   - Mash/blend brain thoroughly
   - Mix with warm water to thin paste
   - Add small amount of soap
3. Work brain solution into hide:
   - Soak hide in solution, massage thoroughly
   - Ensure complete penetration (2-4 hours)
4. Wring out excess
5. Stretch and work hide:
   - Must keep hide moving as it dries
   - Pull, stretch, rub over beam/post
   - 4-8 hours of continuous work
   - Hide becomes soft and white
6. Smoke (makes leather washable):
   - Sew hide into bag shape
   - Suspend over smoldering punk wood (punky, rotted wood)
   - Smoke penetrates, colors leather tan
   - 2-4 hours per side

Brain-tanned leather is soft but less durable than vegetable-tanned. Excellent for clothing, poor for boot soles.

**Rawhide (Untanned):**

For maximum strength when flexibility isn't needed:
1. Flesh and dehair hide
2. Stretch tight on frame
3. Dry completely
4. Optionally oil lightly

Uses: Drum heads, laces, bindings, mallet heads

Rawhide is strong when dry but will rot if kept wet.

### Leather Working

**Cutting:**
- Sharp knife on hard surface
- Straight edge for straight cuts
- Pattern templates for complex shapes

**Hole Punching:**
- Awl: Pointed tool, makes small round holes
- Punch: Hollow tube with sharpened edge, larger holes
- Work on wooden block

**Stitching:**
Saddle Stitch (strongest):
1. Mark stitch line
2. Punch holes with awl (consistent spacing)
3. Use two needles, one on each end of waxed thread
4. Pass through same hole from opposite sides
5. Pull tight
6. Repeat

Creates strong, flat seam.

**Edge Finishing:**
1. Bevel edges with edge beveler or sharp knife
2. Sand smooth
3. Burnish with slicker (smooth hardwood) and water
4. Creates smooth, finished appearance

### Leather Uses

**Boots:**
- Sole: 8-12 oz vegetable-tanned leather (thick)
- Upper: 4-6 oz vegetable-tanned or chrome-tanned
- Lining: 2-3 oz soft leather or fabric

Boot construction is complex - requires patterns and specialized knowledge. Priority skill to learn.

**Harnesses:**
- 8-12 oz vegetable-tanned leather
- All stress points reinforced
- Proper harness allows one horse to pull 1-2 tons

**Belts:**
- 8-10 oz vegetable-tanned leather
- Can be tooled for decoration

**Protective Gear:**
- Aprons: 4-6 oz leather (welding, smithing)
- Gloves: 2-4 oz soft leather
- Leggings: 4-6 oz leather (brush protection)

**Tool Handles/Sheaths:**
- 6-8 oz firm leather
- Wet-form around object, dry while shaped

## Sewing and Mending

### Needle Making

Needles are small but critical. Difficult to fabricate well.

**Salvage Priority:**
Hoard all needles, especially:
- Sewing needles (various sizes)
- Leather needles (triangular point)
- Sailmaking needles (heavy duty)
- Knitting needles
- Upholstery needles (curved)

**Fabrication (Difficult):**

From bone:
1. Select dense bone (bird leg bones ideal)
2. Saw thin slivers
3. Grind to size on abrasive stone
4. Drill eye with fine drill (hardest part)
5. Polish smooth

From wire:
1. Straighten wire (steel, brass, or copper)
2. Hammer flat at one end
3. Drill or punch eye
4. Grind/file point at other end
5. Harden (for steel): Heat to cherry red, quench in oil
6. Polish smooth

Good needles are valuable trade items.

### Thread Production

**Sewing Thread:**
- Spin finer than weaving yarn
- 2-ply or 3-ply for strength
- Wax with beeswax for easier stitching and rot resistance

Linen makes strongest sewing thread.

**Heavy Thread for Leather:**
- Thicker, tightly plied
- Always waxed
- Can also use thin leather strips or sinew

### Basic Hand Stitches

**Running Stitch:**
- Simplest: In and out in straight line
- Use for basting, gathering

**Backstitch:**
- Very strong
- Each stitch goes back half its length
- Use for seams under stress

**Whip Stitch:**
- Over edge of fabric
- Use for finishing raw edges, joining pieces edge-to-edge

**Blanket Stitch:**
- Decorative edge finish
- Also reinforces edge

**Buttonhole Stitch:**
- Variation of blanket stitch
- Reinforces buttonholes against fraying

### Pattern Making

**Taking Measurements:**
Critical measurements for garments:
- Chest/bust: Around fullest part
- Waist: Natural waistline
- Hips: Around fullest part
- Sleeve length: Shoulder to wrist
- Inseam: Crotch to ankle
- Back length: Neck to waist

**Basic Patterns:**

Rectangular construction (simplest):
- Tunic: One rectangle for body (width = chest + ease, length = desired length)
- Add rectangles for sleeves
- Minimal cutting, maximum fabric efficiency
- Ancient method, still practical

Fitted patterns:
- Create by draping fabric on person
- Mark and cut
- Refine through fitting
- Create paper pattern from successful garment for future use

**Seam Allowance:**
Add 1/2 to 5/8 inch beyond marked line for seams.

## Clothing Construction Priorities

Focus on high-impact items first:

### Immediate Needs (Year 1)

**Work Clothes:**
- Heavy pants: Canvas or duck cloth, reinforced knees
- Work shirts: Medium-weight fabric, long sleeves (sun protection)
- Aprons: Protect primary clothing
- Hats: Sun protection critical

**Underwear:**
- Light cotton or linen (next to skin)
- Extends life of outer garments
- Easier to wash than heavy outer clothes

### Critical (Year 2-3)

**Cold Weather Gear:**
- Wool sweaters: Can knit or weave thick fabric
- Wool socks: Hand-knit (essential for winter survival)
- Wool cloaks/blankets: Versatile, simple to make
- Mittens: Easier than gloves, almost as functional

**Footwear:**
Most difficult to manufacture well:
- Simple moccasins: One piece of leather, gathered seam
- Turnshoes: Leather upper stitched to leather sole, turned right-side-out
- Welted boots: Complex but durable (learn from experienced cobbler if possible)

Footwear failure leads to immobility. This is high-priority skill.

### Important (Year 3+)

**Specialized Clothing:**
- Rain gear: Waxed canvas or oiled wool
- Heavy winter coats: Layered wool
- Protective leather garments

**Bedding:**
- Sheets: Linen or cotton
- Blankets: Wool (woven or fulled)
- Mattress ticking: Heavy cotton or linen

## Timeline and Scale

### Individual Production Rates

Starting from raw materials to finished product (approximate, for experienced workers):

**One Set of Clothing (Shirt and Pants):**
- Growing fiber: 4-6 months (cotton/flax growing season)
- Processing fiber: 8-12 hours (ginning/retting/scutching)
- Spinning: 40-60 hours (yarn for both shirt and pants)
- Weaving: 12-20 hours (fabric yardage)
- Sewing: 8-12 hours (cutting and construction)
- Total labor: 70-100 hours (not counting growing time)

**One Wool Sweater:**
- Sheep raising: Year-round care
- Shearing: 20-30 minutes
- Cleaning: 2-3 hours
- Carding: 3-4 hours (for sweater's worth)
- Spinning: 30-40 hours
- Knitting: 40-60 hours
- Total labor: 75-110 hours (not counting animal care)

### Community Scale

**For Community of 100 People:**

Annual fiber needs:
- 400-500 pounds cotton lint OR
- 500-600 pounds clean wool OR
- Combination of multiple fibers

Dedicated workers required:
- 2-3 people: Fiber processing (full time during harvest)
- 3-4 people: Spinning (year-round)
- 1-2 people: Weaving (year-round)
- 1-2 people: Sewing/mending (year-round)

Additionally:
- 10-20 people: Part-time fiber agriculture (cotton/flax growing) OR
- 1-2 people: Full-time shepherding (30-40 sheep flock)

Total commitment: 7-10 full-time equivalent positions

### Scaling Production

Early period (Year 1-3):
- Focus on mending and extending salvaged clothing
- Begin fiber production on small scale
- Train workers in all skills
- Simple items only (shifts, tunics, simple pants)

Established period (Year 4-10):
- Full fiber production
- Specialized workers (dedicated spinners, weavers, etc.)
- More complex items (fitted clothing, winter gear)
- Begin stockpiling for trade

Long-term (Year 10+):
- Consistent surplus production
- High-quality specialized items
- Export/trade textiles to other communities
- Advanced techniques (complex weaving patterns, fine knitting, tailoring)

### Critical Path Items

Cannot wait to develop:
1. Footwear production (most difficult, most critical)
2. Cold weather gear (if in cold climate)
3. Work gloves/protective gear (prevents injuries that reduce productivity)
4. Seed stock (cotton, flax) and breeding stock (sheep)

Can be delayed:
1. Decorative items
2. Fine/luxury textiles
3. Complex patterns
4. Fashion/style considerations

## Integration with Other Technologies

Textiles connect to:
- Agriculture (Tier 1): Fiber crop production, sheep raising
- Metalworking (Tier 2): Needles, scissors, shears, loom parts
- Chemistry (Tier 2): Soap for cleaning, mordants for dyeing
- Woodworking (Tier 1): Loom construction, spinning wheels
- Pottery (Tier 1): Dye vats, washing vessels

Textile production should begin immediately but will improve significantly as other technologies develop.

## Conclusion

Textile production is labor-intensive and cannot be rushed. A community that neglects this technology will face clothing shortages within 2-3 years, leading to reduced work capacity, illness from exposure, and potential loss of life during winter.

Begin learning these skills while modern clothing still exists. Start small: hand spindle and simple frame loom. Build skills and infrastructure gradually. By Year 3-4, you should have basic production capability. By Year 10, a well-organized community can produce surplus textiles for trade.

The most common mistake is underestimating the labor requirements. Allocate sufficient workers to textile production or everyone will be wearing rags within five years.

Textiles are not glamorous technology, but they are fundamental to survival.
