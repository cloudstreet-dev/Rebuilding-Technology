# Chapter 2: Metallurgy and Metalworking

## Why Metallurgy Comes First

Before you can build electronics, generators, or computers, you need the ability to work metal. Metal provides:
- **Structural support**: Frames, housings, chassis
- **Conductors**: Wire, bus bars, contacts
- **Machine components**: Gears, shafts, bearings, tools
- **Heat management**: Heat sinks, boilers, furnaces

This chapter covers both working salvaged metals and eventually refining new metals from ore.

## Understanding Metals

### Basic Properties

**Ferrous Metals (Iron-based)**:
- Iron (pure): Soft, magnetic, rusts easily, melting point 1,538°C
- Steel (iron + <2% carbon): Harder, stronger than pure iron
  - Low carbon steel: Easy to weld and form, most common
  - High carbon steel: Harder, holds an edge, used for tools
  - Stainless steel (iron + chromium + nickel): Corrosion-resistant, harder to work
- Cast iron (iron + >2% carbon): Brittle but easy to cast, excellent compression strength

**Non-Ferrous Metals**:
- Copper: Excellent conductor, corrosion-resistant, melting point 1,085°C
- Aluminum: Lightweight, good conductor, corrosion-resistant, melting point 660°C
- Lead: Soft, dense, toxic, melting point 327°C
- Zinc: Corrosion-resistant coating, melting point 420°C
- Tin: Soft, corrosion-resistant, melting point 232°C
- Brass (copper + zinc): Harder than copper, machinable, nice appearance
- Bronze (copper + tin): Historically important, strong, corrosion-resistant
- Silver: Best conductor, expensive, melting point 962°C
- Gold: Never corrodes, excellent conductor, very expensive, melting point 1,064°C

### Testing Metals

**Magnet Test**:
- Magnetic: Iron, steel, nickel
- Non-magnetic: Copper, aluminum, brass, bronze, stainless steel (most grades)

**Spark Test** (grind metal on wheel, observe sparks):
- Low carbon steel: Long yellow-white streaks
- High carbon steel: Burst sparks, many branches
- Stainless steel: Few sparks, red/orange color
- Cast iron: Short red sparks
- Non-ferrous metals: No sparks or very few

**Color and Weight**:
- Copper: Reddish-brown (may be green if oxidized)
- Brass: Yellow-gold
- Bronze: Reddish-brown (darker than copper)
- Aluminum: Silver-white, very light
- Lead: Dull gray, very heavy
- Zinc: Bluish-white tint
- Stainless: Shiny silver, doesn't rust

**File Test**:
- Soft metals (lead, copper, aluminum): File cuts easily
- Hardened steel: File skates across surface
- Brass/bronze: File cuts but with more resistance than copper

## Heat Sources for Metalworking

You'll need different temperatures for different tasks:

### Low Heat (up to 500°C): Wood Fire
**Construction**: Simple stone or brick enclosure, wood fuel
**Uses**:
- Annealing copper and aluminum
- Melting lead, tin, zinc
- Preheating for welding
**Advantages**: Easy to build, fuel widely available
**Limitations**: Not hot enough for iron/steel work

### Medium Heat (up to 1,100°C): Charcoal Forge
**Construction**:
```
Fire pot (clay or firebrick)
    |
    + Air supply (bellows or blower)
    |
    + Charcoal fuel
    |
    = 1,000-1,100°C
```

**Building a Simple Forge**:
1. **Fire pot**: Dig depression or build clay/brick bowl, 30-40 cm across
2. **Air supply**:
   - Pipe (iron or copper) leading to bottom/side of fire pot
   - Connected to bellows or salvaged blower motor
   - Adjustable air flow (more air = hotter fire)
3. **Fuel**: Charcoal (making charcoal covered below)
4. **Work area**: Flat area around fire pot to rest work, tools

**Making Charcoal**:
- Method 1: Burn wood in limited oxygen (in sealed metal container with small vent)
- Method 2: Build wood pile, cover with dirt, light small fire at center, control air flow
- Result: Wood converts to nearly pure carbon, burns much hotter than wood
- Yield: Approximately 1 part charcoal from 4-5 parts wood by weight

**Uses**:
- Forging iron and steel
- Melting copper, brass, bronze
- Heat treating steel
**Advantages**: Hot enough for most metalworking
**Limitations**: Not hot enough to melt iron (need 1,538°C)

### High Heat (up to 1,600°C+): Blast Furnace
**Construction**: Much larger, forced air blast, can use coke (processed coal) or charcoal
**Uses**: Melting iron, refining ore
**Note**: Covered in "Mining and Refining" section below

## Basic Metalworking Techniques

### Cutting

**Sawing**:
- Hacksaw: Fine-toothed blade for metal, salvage these tools
- Band saw: Powered, continuous blade, very efficient (if you have electricity)
- Abrasive cutoff: Grinding wheel cuts through metal (powered tool)

**Shearing**:
- Tin snips: Cut thin sheet metal (up to ~1 mm)
- Bench shears: Larger, lever-operated, thicker sheets
- Hydraulic shears: Industrial, cut thick plate (salvage if you find them)

**Drilling**:
- Hand drill: Slow but works without power
- Power drill: Much faster, variable speeds
- Drill press: Stationary, precise, powerful
- Bits: High-speed steel (HSS) for general use, carbide for hardened materials
- Lubrication: Use cutting oil or even water to cool bit and metal

**Grinding**:
- Bench grinder: Powered, shapes and sharpens
- Angle grinder: Portable, cuts and grinds
- Files: Hand tool, various coarseness, shapes metal slowly but precisely

### Forming (Shaping Without Removing Material)

**Hammering**:
- Cold working: Shape soft metals (copper, aluminum, thin steel) at room temperature
- Hot working: Heat steel to red heat (700-900°C), then hammer
- Tools needed:
  - Hammer (2-3 lb for general work)
  - Anvil (flat, heavy steel surface—improvise from railroad track or heavy steel block)
  - Tongs (hold hot metal safely)

**Basic Forging Process**:
1. Heat metal to red-orange (use magnet to test: steel loses magnetism when hot enough)
2. Place on anvil
3. Strike with hammer to shape
4. Reheat when metal darkens (below working temperature)
5. Cool slowly for soft metal, or quench for hardening (see heat treating below)

**Bending**:
- Cold bending: Soft metals, thin stock, use vise and leverage
- Hot bending: Steel, thick stock, heat then bend
- Tube bending: Use mandrel (internal support) to prevent collapse

**Rolling**:
- Sheet roller: Forms curves in sheet metal
- Wire roller: Creates wire from rod stock
- Construction: Salvage or build with cylinders and gears

**Drawing**:
- Wire drawing: Pull metal through progressively smaller holes to make wire
- Dies: Hardened steel plate with precise holes
- Process: Start with rod, anneal (soften), pull through die, anneal again, repeat
- Result: Each pass reduces diameter ~10-20%

### Joining

**Mechanical Fastening**:
- Bolts and nuts: Removable, strong, salvage from old equipment
- Rivets: Permanent, strong, good for sheet metal
  - Process: Drill hole, insert rivet, hammer end to mushroom it
- Screws: Removable, less strong than bolts, very common

**Welding** (Most Important Joining Method):

**Forge Welding** (oldest method, no equipment needed):
- Heat two pieces of steel to white heat (1,300°C+)
- Use flux (borax) to prevent oxidation
- Hammer together while hot—atoms bond
- Difficulty: High, requires skill and precise heat
- Advantage: No special equipment

**Arc Welding** (requires electricity):
- Principle: Electric arc (4,000-6,000°C) melts metals together
- Equipment needed:
  - Welding machine: Transforms power to high current (100-200 amps), low voltage (20-30V)
  - Electrode holder and ground clamp
  - Electrodes (consumable rods) or filler wire
  - Helmet with dark glass (arc is blinding and burns skin)
  - Gloves and protective clothing

**Types of Arc Welding**:

1. **Stick Welding (SMAW - Shielded Metal Arc Welding)**:
   - Electrode: Metal rod with flux coating
   - Flux melts, creates gas shield, prevents oxidation
   - Slag forms on top, chip off when cool
   - Most versatile, works outdoors, dirty materials
   - Easiest to improvise

2. **MIG Welding (GMAW - Gas Metal Arc Welding)**:
   - Continuous wire fed from spool
   - Shielding gas (argon or CO2) from tank
   - Faster, cleaner than stick
   - Requires gas supply (can make CO2, see Chapter 4)

3. **TIG Welding (GTAW - Gas Tungsten Arc Welding)**:
   - Non-consumable tungsten electrode
   - Separate filler rod
   - Shielding gas (argon)
   - Most precise, cleanest, strongest welds
   - Difficult to learn, slowest

**Building a Simple Arc Welder**:
- Need: Transformer to step down voltage, increase current
- Salvage from:
  - Microwave oven transformers (2-3 in series)
  - Old welding machines
  - Large industrial transformers
- Circuit: AC power → Transformer → Welding leads
- Safety: Proper grounding, insulated leads, circuit breaker

**Soldering and Brazing** (Lower Temperature Joining):

**Soldering** (melting point <450°C):
- Filler metal: Solder (traditionally tin-lead, now often tin-copper-silver)
- Heat source: Soldering iron or torch
- Flux: Rosin or acid flux to clean surfaces
- Uses: Electronics, copper plumbing, sheet metal
- Strength: Weak, not for structural loads
- Process:
  1. Clean surfaces
  2. Apply flux
  3. Heat parts with iron
  4. Apply solder, let it flow
  5. Remove heat, hold still until cool

**Brazing** (melting point 450-900°C):
- Filler metal: Brass alloys, bronze, or silver-copper alloys
- Heat source: Torch (propane, MAPP gas, or acetylene)
- Flux: Borax or proprietary flux
- Uses: Joining dissimilar metals, thin to thick, copper pipes
- Strength: Stronger than solder, weaker than welding
- Process: Similar to soldering but higher heat

### Casting (Pouring Molten Metal into Molds)

**Sand Casting** (most accessible method):

**Materials**:
- Sand: Fine sand mixed with clay (5-10% clay content) to hold shape
- Or use "green sand": Sand + bentonite clay + water
- Pattern: Object shape (wood, metal, plastic) to create cavity
- Flask: Frame to hold sand (wood or metal box)
- Crucible: Container to melt metal (graphite, ceramic, or iron for aluminum/copper)

**Process**:
1. **Make pattern**: Carve or form the shape you want to cast
2. **Pack sand**: Place pattern in flask, pack sand around it firmly
3. **Remove pattern**: Carefully extract pattern, leaving cavity
4. **Create pour spout and vents**: Channels for metal to flow in, air to escape
5. **Prepare mold**: Close flask, ready to pour
6. **Melt metal**: Heat in crucible until liquid
7. **Pour**: Carefully pour molten metal into mold
8. **Cool**: Wait for solidification (minutes to hours depending on size)
9. **Break mold**: Remove sand, retrieve casting
10. **Finish**: Grind off imperfections, machine if needed

**Metals for Casting** (by difficulty):
- Easiest: Lead, tin (low melting point, but lead is toxic)
- Easy: Aluminum (660°C, lightweight)
- Moderate: Copper, brass, bronze (1,000-1,100°C)
- Difficult: Iron (1,538°C, needs blast furnace)

**Lost Wax Casting** (for precision):
1. Carve pattern from wax
2. Cover with clay or plaster
3. Heat: Wax melts out, leaving perfect cavity
4. Pour metal
5. Break mold
- Advantage: Very detailed, smooth finish
- Disadvantage: One-time use (can't reuse mold)

**Permanent Molds**:
- Iron or steel mold (two pieces)
- For repeated castings of same part
- Construction: Machine or cast the mold itself
- Limited to metals with lower melting point than mold (aluminum in iron molds)

## Heat Treating Steel

Steel's properties can be dramatically changed by heating and cooling:

### Annealing (Softening)
**Purpose**: Make steel soft and easy to work
**Process**:
1. Heat to 700-800°C (cherry red)
2. Hold temperature for 15-60 minutes
3. Cool very slowly (in furnace, in sand, or bury in ashes)
**Result**: Soft, not brittle, easy to machine or form

### Hardening
**Purpose**: Make steel hard (for cutting tools, wear surfaces)
**Process**:
1. Heat to 800-900°C (bright red)
2. Quench (plunge) into water, oil, or brine
3. Cool rapidly
**Result**: Very hard, but brittle
**Note**: Only works on medium to high carbon steel (>0.4% carbon)

**Quenching Media**:
- Water: Fastest cooling, hardest result, risk of cracking
- Oil: Slower cooling, less risk of cracking, slightly softer
- Brine (salt water): Faster than plain water
- Air: Very slow, only for certain alloy steels

### Tempering (Reducing Brittleness)
**Purpose**: After hardening, reduce brittleness while keeping most hardness
**Process**:
1. After hardening and quenching, clean scale off steel
2. Gently heat to 200-300°C (observe color changes)
3. Watch for color:
   - Pale yellow (230°C): Very hard, cutting tools
   - Straw (250°C): Hard, drills, taps
   - Brown (270°C): Medium hard, punches
   - Purple (290°C): Tough, springs, chisels
   - Blue (320°C): Flexible, swords, springs
4. Quench when desired color is reached
**Result**: Tougher, less likely to shatter, still hard

### Case Hardening (Hardening Surface Only)
**Purpose**: Hard surface on soft core (gears, shafts)
**Process**:
1. Pack low-carbon steel in carbon-rich material (charcoal, bone meal)
2. Heat to 900-950°C for hours
3. Carbon diffuses into surface
4. Quench to harden
**Result**: Hard outer layer, tough inner core

## Precision Metalworking

### The Lathe (Most Important Machine Tool)

**What It Does**: Rotates work piece, cutting tool shapes it
**Operations**:
- Turning: Reduce diameter, create cylinders
- Facing: Cut flat ends
- Boring: Enlarge holes
- Threading: Cut screw threads
- Drilling: On-axis holes
- Knurling: Grip patterns

**Basic Components**:
- Bed: Rigid base
- Headstock: Rotates work (motor or hand-crank)
- Tailstock: Supports other end of work
- Carriage: Holds cutting tool, moves along bed
- Cross-slide: Moves cutting tool in/out
- Cutting tool: High-speed steel or carbide

**Salvage Priority**: High. A lathe lets you make precision cylinders, threads, and shafts. You can even use a lathe to help build another lathe.

**Improvising a Lathe**:
- Simplest: Headstock from salvaged motor, tailstock from bearings and pipe
- Bed: Steel channel or welded frame
- Tool rest: Adjustable height platform
- Hand-powered: Crank or treadle instead of motor

### The Milling Machine

**What It Does**: Cutting tool rotates, work piece moves under it
**Operations**:
- Face milling: Flatten surfaces
- End milling: Cut slots, pockets, contours
- Drilling: Precise hole placement
- Gear cutting: With special attachments

**Components**:
- Base and column: Support structure
- Spindle: Rotates cutting tool
- Table: Holds work, moves in X-Y-Z directions
- Cutting tools: End mills, face mills, various shapes

**Salvage Priority**: High, but lower than lathe. Can substitute with drill press and creative fixturing.

### The Drill Press

**What It Does**: Drills precise, perpendicular holes
**Advantages Over Hand Drilling**:
- Accuracy
- Repeatability
- Can use larger bits
- Variable speed

**Salvage Priority**: Medium. Very useful, but hand drills can substitute in early stages.

### Grinding and Precision Finishing

**Surface Grinder**: Flattens surfaces to extreme precision
**Cylindrical Grinder**: Precision diameters
**Tool and Cutter Grinder**: Sharpens cutting tools

**Priority**: Lower in early stages, critical for precision work later

### Measurement Tools

You can't build precision parts without measurement:

**Essential Tools**:
1. **Ruler/Scale**: Basic measurement, 1mm precision at best
2. **Calipers**: Inside/outside/depth measurement, 0.1mm precision
   - Vernier calipers (no power needed)
   - Dial calipers (easier to read)
   - Digital calipers (needs battery)
3. **Micrometer**: Very precise (0.01mm), for critical dimensions
4. **Squares**: Check perpendicularity
5. **Levels**: Check horizontal/vertical
6. **Gauge blocks**: Precision reference standards (salvage if you find them!)

**Salvage Priority**: Critical. These are difficult to make accurately. Preserve any you find.

## Working Specific Metals

### Iron and Steel

**Salvage Sources**: Structural steel, rebar, vehicles, tools
**Working Temperature**: 700-1,100°C (red to orange heat)
**Challenges**: High melting point, rusts easily
**Tips**:
- Keep dry when storing
- Use oil or paint to prevent rust
- Anneal before machining if too hard
- Preheat before welding thick sections

### Copper

**Salvage Sources**: Wire, pipe, electrical components
**Working Temperature**: Can work cold, anneal at 400-600°C
**Challenges**: Work-hardens (gets brittle when hammered)
**Tips**:
- Anneals easily—heat to dull red, quench or air cool
- Excellent for electrical work
- Can be drawn into very fine wire
- Corrosion (green patina) is only surface deep

### Aluminum

**Salvage Sources**: Window frames, siding, vehicles
**Working Temperature**: Room temp to 500°C for forming
**Challenges**:
- Difficult to weld (needs special process or filler)
- No color change when heated (hard to judge temperature)
- Melts suddenly at 660°C
**Tips**:
- Mark with temperature-indicating crayon if welding
- Excellent for casting (low melting point)
- Very lightweight—good for any mobile applications
- Different alloys have very different properties

### Brass and Bronze

**Salvage Sources**: Fittings, valves, decorative items, bearings
**Working Temperature**: Can work cold or hot (700-800°C)
**Challenges**: Can contain lead (older alloys)
**Tips**:
- Excellent for casting
- Machines beautifully
- Corrosion-resistant
- Good for bearings (bronze especially)

### Lead

**Salvage Sources**: Batteries, wheel weights, old pipes, radiation shielding
**Working Temperature**: Melts at 327°C (very low)
**Challenges**: TOXIC—never heat without ventilation, always wash hands after handling
**Tips**:
- Good for casting small parts (weights, type, bullets)
- Soft—easily formed
- Dense—useful for radiation shielding, counterweights
- Never use lead containers for food or water

## Mining and Refining (Post-Salvage Era)

Eventually, salvage will be depleted. You'll need to mine and refine ore:

### Finding Ores

**Visual Indicators**:
- **Iron**: Red/brown rust colors in rock, heavy black magnetic rocks (magnetite)
- **Copper**: Green staining (malachite), blue staining (azurite)
- **Lead**: Shiny gray metal in rock (galena)
- **Tin**: Black or brown crystals (cassiterite)
- **Aluminum**: Red rock (bauxite)—but very hard to refine

**Old Mines**: Locations where mining occurred before may still have ore

**Stream Panning**: Heavy metals concentrate in stream beds

### Refining Iron from Ore

**Bloomery Furnace** (ancient method, no blast furnace needed):

**Construction**:
- Stone/clay tower, 1-2 meters tall
- Air supply at bottom (bellows or blower)
- Fuel: Charcoal
- Temperature: 1,200-1,300°C

**Process**:
1. Fill furnace with alternating layers of iron ore and charcoal
2. Ignite charcoal, blast air from bottom
3. Iron ore reduces to metallic iron (but doesn't melt)
4. Iron forms spongy "bloom" at bottom
5. Remove bloom (3-5 kg typical)
6. Hammer bloom to squeeze out slag, consolidate iron
7. Repeat hammering and folding to improve quality

**Yield**: Low (50-70% of iron in ore)
**Result**: Wrought iron (low carbon, tough, easily worked)

**Blast Furnace** (more efficient, requires infrastructure):
- Much larger (5-30 meters tall)
- Continuous operation
- Produces molten pig iron (high carbon)
- Requires more sophisticated air blast
- Need to convert pig iron to steel (reduce carbon)

### Refining Copper from Ore

**Smelting Copper**:
1. Crush ore (malachite, azurite, or sulfide ores)
2. Roast sulfide ores to drive off sulfur (produces toxic SO2—do outdoors!)
3. Mix with charcoal and flux (limestone or sand)
4. Heat to 1,200°C in furnace
5. Copper melts, slag floats on top
6. Pour off copper, cast into ingots

**Purity**: May need refining for electrical use
**Refining**: Melt and oxidize impurities, or use electrolysis (needs electrical power)

### Refining Aluminum (Very Difficult)

**Why Difficult**: Aluminum oxide (bauxite) very stable, requires electrolysis at high temperature

**Hall-Héroult Process** (only practical method):
1. Dissolve aluminum oxide in molten cryolite (950°C)
2. Pass huge electric current through solution
3. Aluminum deposits at cathode (negative electrode)
4. Oxygen released at anode (positive electrode)

**Energy Requirement**: Enormous—approximately 15 kWh per kg of aluminum
**Implication**: Don't attempt until you have large-scale electrical generation
**Alternative**: Salvage and recycle aluminum extensively

### Refining Other Metals

**Zinc**: Roast ore, reduce with carbon, distill (boils at 907°C)
**Tin**: Smelt cassiterite ore with carbon (similar to copper)
**Lead**: Smelt galena ore (very easy, low temperature)
**Silver/Gold**: Often found in lead ores, separate by cupellation or chemical methods

## Next Steps

With metalworking capability established, you can now:
1. Build and repair tools
2. Construct electrical generators (Chapter 3)
3. Create chemical processing equipment (Chapter 4)
4. Manufacture electronic components (Chapter 5)

Metalworking is the foundation. Master it, and you can build almost anything.

**Key Takeaway**: Start with salvaged metals and simple techniques. Build skill and infrastructure gradually. Don't attempt to mine and refine until you've exhausted salvage and developed expertise with the material.
