# Chapter 2: Metallurgy and Metalworking

## Why Metallurgy Comes First

Before you can build electronics, generators, or computers, you need the ability to work metal. Metal provides:
- **Structural support**: Frames, housings, chassis
- **Conductors**: Wire, bus bars, contacts
- **Machine components**: Gears, shafts, bearings, tools
- **Heat management**: Heat sinks, boilers, furnaces

This chapter covers both working salvaged metals and eventually refining new metals from ore.

## Understanding Metals

### Basic Properties

**Ferrous Metals (Iron-based)**:
- Iron (pure): Soft, magnetic, rusts easily, melting point 1,538°C
- Steel (iron + <2% carbon): Harder, stronger than pure iron
  - Low carbon steel: Easy to weld and form, most common
  - High carbon steel: Harder, holds an edge, used for tools
  - Stainless steel (iron + chromium + nickel): Corrosion-resistant, harder to work
- Cast iron (iron + >2% carbon): Brittle but easy to cast, excellent compression strength
  - **Welding note**: Cast iron is essentially unweldable with standard arc welding techniques
  - **Problem**: High carbon content and brittle structure cause cracking when welded
  - **Repair**: Requires specialized nickel-rod welding or brazing (see below)
  - **Do NOT attempt** standard arc welding on broken cast iron parts (engine blocks, old tools) - will crack

**Non-Ferrous Metals**:
- Copper: Excellent conductor, corrosion-resistant, melting point 1,085°C
- Aluminum: Lightweight, good conductor, corrosion-resistant, melting point 660°C
- Lead: Soft, dense, toxic, melting point 327°C
- Zinc: Corrosion-resistant coating, melting point 420°C
- Tin: Soft, corrosion-resistant, melting point 232°C
- Brass (copper + zinc): Harder than copper, machinable, nice appearance
- Bronze (copper + tin): Historically important, strong, corrosion-resistant
- Silver: Best conductor, expensive, melting point 962°C
- Gold: Never corrodes, excellent conductor, very expensive, melting point 1,064°C

### Testing Metals

**Magnet Test**:
- Magnetic: Iron, steel, nickel
- Non-magnetic: Copper, aluminum, brass, bronze, stainless steel (most grades)

**Spark Test** (grind metal on wheel, observe sparks):

This test identifies metal type by grinding a small sample on a grinding wheel and observing the spark pattern.

- **Low carbon steel** (mild steel): Long yellow-white streaks, few branches, smooth flow
- **Medium carbon steel**: More branching than low carbon, brighter yellow sparks
- **High carbon steel / Tool steel**: **Most dramatic burst sparks**, many fine branches exploding from main stream, bright white-yellow color
  - This is the key identifier for tool steel
  - Looks like tiny fireworks
- **Stainless steel**: Few sparks, red/orange color, short length, intermittent
- **Cast iron**: Short red-orange sparks, many fine branches near wheel, burst pattern
- **Wrought iron**: Long yellow streaks with forked ends
- **Non-ferrous metals** (copper, aluminum, brass, bronze): No sparks or very few weak sparks

**Tool Steel Identification (Critical for Making Tools)**:

Tool steel is high-carbon steel (0.7-1.5% carbon) specifically designed to hold an edge and withstand wear. Recognizing it is critical because you can make cutting tools, dies, and precision instruments from it.

**Common salvage sources for tool steel**:
1. **Leaf springs** (vehicle suspension): Excellent tool steel, readily available, large pieces
   - Usually 0.8-1.0% carbon, perfect for knives, chisels, axes
   - Most common source for post-collapse toolmaking
2. **Coil springs** (car suspensions, garage doors): Good tool steel, but curved (requires straightening)
3. **Files**: Very hard tool steel (already hardened), excellent for small tools
   - Grind off teeth, forge/grind to shape
4. **Saw blades** (hand saws, bandsaw blades): High-carbon steel, good for knives
5. **Ball bearings** (large ones from machinery): Very hard tool steel, but small and round
   - Useful for punches, small cutting edges
6. **Old cutting tools** (chisels, plane blades, drill bits): Obviously tool steel, can be reshaped
7. **Railroad spikes** (sometimes): Variable quality, test with spark test
   - NOT reliable—many are mild steel, some are medium carbon

**How to identify tool steel with spark test**:
- Grind sample on wheel
- Look for bright white-yellow sparks with heavy branching and bursting
- Compare to known mild steel (mild steel has less branching, more flowing)
- If in doubt, test hardenability: Heat to bright red, quench in water. If it becomes very hard (file won't cut it), it's tool steel.

**Why tool steel matters**:
- Can be hardened to hold cutting edge (axes, chisels, knives, saw blades)
- Essential for making tools that make other tools
- Salvaging high-quality tool steel (leaf springs) is priority in early salvage operations

**Color and Weight**:
- Copper: Reddish-brown (may be green if oxidized)
- Brass: Yellow-gold
- Bronze: Reddish-brown (darker than copper)
- Aluminum: Silver-white, very light
- Lead: Dull gray, very heavy
- Zinc: Bluish-white tint
- Stainless: Shiny silver, doesn't rust

**File Test**:
- Soft metals (lead, copper, aluminum): File cuts easily
- Hardened steel: File skates across surface
- Brass/bronze: File cuts but with more resistance than copper

## Heat Sources for Metalworking

You'll need different temperatures for different tasks:

### Low Heat (up to 500°C): Wood Fire
**Construction**: Simple stone or brick enclosure, wood fuel
**Uses**:
- Annealing copper and aluminum
- Melting lead, tin, zinc
- Preheating for welding
**Advantages**: Easy to build, fuel widely available
**Limitations**: Not hot enough for iron/steel work

### Medium Heat (up to 1,100°C): Charcoal Forge
**Construction**:
```
Fire pot (clay or firebrick)
    |
    + Air supply (bellows or blower)
    |
    + Charcoal fuel
    |
    = 1,000-1,100°C
```

**Building a Simple Forge**:
1. **Fire pot**: Dig depression or build clay/brick bowl, 30-40 cm across
2. **Air supply**:
   - Pipe (iron or copper) leading to bottom/side of fire pot
   - Connected to bellows or salvaged blower motor
   - Adjustable air flow (more air = hotter fire)
3. **Fuel**: Charcoal (making charcoal covered below)
4. **Work area**: Flat area around fire pot to rest work, tools

**Building Bellows** (Essential for Communities Without Electrical Blowers):

A forge requires continuous air blast. While salvaged electric blowers work, they require electricity. Bellows are mechanical air pumps that work without power.

**Double-Lung Bellows (Most Effective Design)**:

**Materials**:
- Leather (thick, flexible): 1-2 square meters (salvage from old jackets, boots, car seats, or belts)
  - Alternative: Heavy canvas, rubberized fabric, or multiple layers of cloth sealed with tar/pitch
- Wood: Planks for top and bottom boards (30 cm × 40 cm each), handles, pivot point
- Nails or screws: For assembly
- Hinge: Leather or metal (salvaged door hinge works)
- Valves: One-way air valves (can be simple leather flaps)

**Construction**:

**Air chamber body**:
1. Cut two wooden boards: Top board and bottom board (30 cm × 40 cm, or larger for more air volume)
2. Round or bevel edges (prevents sharp corners from tearing leather)
3. Cut leather to form sides: Create pleated/accordion sides that allow expansion
   - Cut large piece that wraps around sides when bellows is closed
   - Attach with small nails or glue around edges of top and bottom boards
4. Seal edges: Ensure airtight seal (use tar, pitch, or glue)

**Valves (Critical - Allow Air In, Prevent Backflow)**:
1. **Intake valve** (bottom board): Small hole (2-3 cm diameter) with leather flap attached on inside
   - When bellows expands (pulling boards apart), flap opens, air rushes in
   - When bellows compresses, flap closes, air can't escape back out
2. **Output valve** (bottom board): Connect air pipe to forge
   - Simple hole with pipe fitted tightly
   - Or add one-way valve here too (prevents backflow from forge)

**Handles and Pivot**:
1. Attach handle to top board (user lifts and pushes)
2. Bottom board can rest on ground or be attached to frame
3. Some designs use pivot point in middle (lever action)

**Double-Lung System (Two Bellows, Alternating)**:
- Build two single bellows
- Connect outputs to common air pipe via Y-junction
- Operate alternately (one compresses while other expands)
- Result: Continuous air flow (not pulsed)
- One person can operate: Push down on one bellows with hand, pull up other with foot, alternate

**Single-Lung Bellows (Simpler, But Pulsed Airflow)**:
- Just one bellows chamber
- Pull up to fill with air, push down to blast into forge
- Pros: Simpler to build
- Cons: Intermittent airflow (need to pause to refill)

**Operation**:
1. Position near forge with air pipe leading to fire pot
2. Compress bellows (push handles together)
3. Air blasts into forge, intensifying fire
4. Expand bellows (pull handles apart)
5. Intake valve opens, refills with air
6. Repeat rhythmically (faster pumping = hotter forge)

**Maintenance**:
- Check leather for cracks/tears (patch or replace)
- Check valves (leather flaps can dry out and fail)
- Keep leather supple (occasional oiling)
- Replace when air leaks become too severe

**Performance**:
- Good double-lung bellows can maintain forge at 1,000-1,100°C continuously
- Single operator can work for hours (physically tiring but manageable)
- Much quieter than electric blower

**Alternative: Piston Bellows** (Higher Pressure, Continuous Flow):
- Wooden cylinder with piston inside (like a large syringe)
- Requires more precision machining but can be built with lathe
- Can achieve higher sustained pressure for larger forges

**If No Bellows**: Very small forges can use hand-fanning or blowing through pipe, but this is exhausting and inconsistent. Bellows are essential for serious metalwork.

**Making Charcoal** (Critical Process - Detailed):

Charcoal is not simply "burnt wood"—it's wood converted to nearly pure carbon through pyrolysis (heating in limited oxygen). This process takes 2-3 days and requires specific techniques.

**Why Charcoal**:
- Burns much hotter than wood (charcoal reaches 1,100°C with air blast, wood only 600-800°C)
- Cleaner burn (less smoke, ash, and impurities that weaken metal)
- Essential for forging iron/steel and smelting metals

**Method 1: Pit Kiln (Simplest, No Equipment)**

**Construction**:
1. Dig circular pit 1-2 meters diameter, 30-50 cm deep
2. Or build above-ground mound on flat, clear area

**Wood selection**:
- Hardwoods preferred: Oak, hickory, maple, ash (denser, better charcoal)
- Softwoods work but produce lower-quality, more fragile charcoal
- Cut into uniform pieces: 10-15 cm diameter, 30-50 cm length
- Dry wood only (wet wood wastes time and produces poor charcoal)

**Process**:
1. **Stack wood**: Start with vertical stake in center, lean wood pieces teepee-style against it, fill from center outward
2. **Build pile**: Create cone/dome shape, 1.5-2 meters tall at peak
3. **Cover with leaves/grass**: 10-15 cm layer (insulation)
4. **Cover with dirt/turf**: 15-20 cm layer, leave small vents at base and top
5. **Ignite**: Remove center stake, drop burning embers down center hole
6. **Monitor**: Smoke should be thick white (water vapor + volatiles) at first
7. **Control airflow**: Close/open vents to maintain slow, even burn
   - Too much air = wood burns to ash (failure)
   - Too little air = process stops (failure)
   - Correct = thin blue/white smoke, steady smolder
8. **Wait**: 2-3 days for complete conversion (larger piles take longer)
9. **Watch for completion**: Smoke becomes thin and blue-gray, then almost invisible
10. **Seal completely**: Cover all vents with dirt, smother fire
11. **Cool**: Wait 1-2 days (attempting to open hot pit causes charcoal to burn away)
12. **Harvest**: Dig out charcoal, sort by size

**Yield**: Approximately 1 part charcoal from 4-5 parts wood by weight
- Example: 100 kg dry wood → 20-25 kg charcoal
- Volume loss is dramatic (charcoal is much lighter per unit volume)

**Quality indicators**:
- Good charcoal: Rings like a bell when struck, breaks cleanly with sharp edges, lightweight, deep black color
- Poor charcoal: Crumbles into dust, brownish (incompletely converted), heavy (still contains moisture or unconverted wood)

**Method 2: Metal Drum Retort (Better Control, Requires Container)**

**Equipment**: Large metal drum (200-liter oil drum), smaller vent pipe

**Process**:
1. Fill drum with cut wood pieces (packed loosely)
2. Seal lid, create small vent hole (5-10 mm) in lid
3. Build wood fire around and under drum
4. Heat externally (wood inside drum doesn't burn—it's sealed)
5. Flammable gases vent from hole, can be ignited (burns with yellow flame)
6. When gas stops flowing (3-6 hours), process is complete
7. Let cool completely before opening

**Advantages**: Faster (hours vs. days), more consistent quality, can collect wood gas for fuel
**Disadvantages**: Requires metal container

**Storage**:
- Keep charcoal dry (absorbs moisture from air, reduces effectiveness)
- Store in sealed containers or covered area
- Shelf life: Years if kept dry

**Uses**:
- Forging iron and steel
- Melting copper, brass, bronze
- Heat treating steel
**Advantages**: Hot enough for most metalworking
**Limitations**: Not hot enough to melt iron (need 1,538°C)

### High Heat (up to 1,600°C+): Blast Furnace
**Construction**: Much larger, forced air blast, can use coke (processed coal) or charcoal
**Uses**: Melting iron, refining ore
**Note**: Covered in "Mining and Refining" section below

## Basic Metalworking Techniques

### Cutting

**Sawing**:
- Hacksaw: Fine-toothed blade for metal, salvage these tools
- Band saw: Powered, continuous blade, very efficient (if you have electricity)
- Abrasive cutoff: Grinding wheel cuts through metal (powered tool)

**Shearing**:
- Tin snips: Cut thin sheet metal (up to ~1 mm)
- Bench shears: Larger, lever-operated, thicker sheets
- Hydraulic shears: Industrial, cut thick plate (salvage if you find them)

**Drilling**:
- Hand drill: Slow but works without power
- Power drill: Much faster, variable speeds
- Drill press: Stationary, precise, powerful
- Bits: High-speed steel (HSS) for general use, carbide for hardened materials
- Lubrication: Use cutting oil or even water to cool bit and metal

**Grinding**:
- Bench grinder: Powered, shapes and sharpens
- Angle grinder: Portable, cuts and grinds
- Files: Hand tool, various coarseness, shapes metal slowly but precisely

### Forming (Shaping Without Removing Material)

**Hammering**:
- Cold working: Shape soft metals (copper, aluminum, thin steel) at room temperature
- Hot working: Heat steel to red heat (700-900°C), then hammer
- Tools needed:
  - Hammer (2-3 lb for general work)
  - Anvil (flat, heavy steel surface—improvise from railroad track or heavy steel block)
  - Tongs (hold hot metal safely)

**Basic Forging Process**:
1. Heat metal to red-orange (use magnet to test: steel loses magnetism when hot enough)
2. Place on anvil
3. Strike with hammer to shape
4. Reheat when metal darkens (below working temperature)
5. Cool slowly for soft metal, or quench for hardening (see heat treating below)

**Bending**:
- Cold bending: Soft metals, thin stock, use vise and leverage
- Hot bending: Steel, thick stock, heat then bend
- Tube bending: Use mandrel (internal support) to prevent collapse

**Rolling**:
- Sheet roller: Forms curves in sheet metal
- Wire roller: Creates wire from rod stock
- Construction: Salvage or build with cylinders and gears

**Drawing**:
- Wire drawing: Pull metal through progressively smaller holes to make wire
- Dies: Hardened steel plate with precise holes
- Process: Start with rod, anneal (soften), pull through die, anneal again, repeat
- Result: Each pass reduces diameter ~10-20%

**Wire Drawing Die Construction** (Determines Whether Wire Drawing is Possible):

Wire drawing requires precisely sized, hardened holes. Making the dies is often harder than the drawing process itself.

**Materials needed**:
- **Tool steel plate** (salvaged from leaf springs, saw blades, files)
- **Drill bits** in progressively smaller sizes
- **Reamer or tapered punch** for finishing hole
- **Hardening setup** (forge, quenching oil)

**Process**:
1. **Select tool steel plate**: 5-10 mm thick, larger diameter than final hole
2. **Drill pilot hole**: Use smallest drill bit that will drill through
3. **Drill to size**: Progressively larger drill bits approaching final size
   - Stop 0.1-0.3 mm before desired diameter
4. **Ream or polish hole**:
   - Use tapered reamer to bring to exact size
   - Or use abrasive-loaded rod (valve grinding compound on rod, spin through hole)
   - Goal: Smooth, precise diameter
5. **Chamfer entry**: Slight bevel on entry side (prevents wire from catching)
6. **Harden plate**:
   - Heat plate to critical temperature (bright red, ~800-850°C)
   - Quench in oil (water risks cracking thin plate)
7. **Temper**: Gently heat to straw color (~250°C), prevents brittleness
8. **Test**: Pull soft wire (copper or annealed steel) through to verify size and smoothness

**Die progression example** (copper wire, starting from 5mm rod):
- Die 1: 4.0 mm (20% reduction)
- Die 2: 3.3 mm (17.5% reduction)
- Die 3: 2.7 mm (18% reduction)
- Die 4: 2.2 mm (18.5% reduction)
- Die 5: 1.8 mm (18% reduction)
- Die 6: 1.5 mm (16.6% reduction)
- Continue as needed

**Number of dies needed**:
- For fine wire (0.5 mm from 5 mm rod): 10-12 dies
- Each die costs time and precision
- Can reuse dies for different metals

**Challenges**:
- **Precision drilling**: Without drill press, difficult to drill perfectly centered holes
- **Hardening thin plates**: Risk of warping or cracking
- **Measuring hole diameter**: Requires precision measurement (wire gauges, calipers)

**Alternative: Tapered Draw Plate**:
- Drill series of holes in single thick plate (10-20 mm)
- Each hole slightly smaller
- Taper entry side of each hole
- Harden entire plate
- **Advantage**: All dies in one piece
- **Disadvantage**: Thick plate harder to harden evenly

**Reality**: Wire drawing die quality determines wire quality. Poor dies produce rough, inconsistent wire. **Good dies are extremely valuable** - salvage commercial draw plates if found (jewelry supply, wire manufacturing).

### Joining

**Mechanical Fastening**:
- Bolts and nuts: Removable, strong, salvage from old equipment
- Rivets: Permanent, strong, good for sheet metal
  - Process: Drill hole, insert rivet, hammer end to mushroom it
- Screws: Removable, less strong than bolts, very common

**Welding** (Most Important Joining Method):

**Forge Welding** (oldest method, no equipment needed):
- Heat two pieces of steel to white heat (1,300°C+)
- Use flux (borax) to prevent oxidation
- Hammer together while hot—atoms bond
- Difficulty: High, requires skill and precise heat
- Advantage: No special equipment

**Flux for Forge Welding (Critical - Without Flux, Forge Welding is Nearly Impossible)**:

**What flux does**:
- Melts at welding temperature, forms liquid layer on hot steel
- Prevents oxygen from reaching steel surface (oxygen causes scale/oxides that prevent bonding)
- Dissolves existing scale
- Allows clean metal-to-metal contact when hammered together

**Borax (Sodium Tetraborate) - Best Flux for Forge Welding**:

**Post-collapse sources**:
1. **Laundry aisle of stores** (salvage priority):
   - "20 Mule Team Borax" (common laundry booster in USA)
   - Usually in 1-2 kg boxes, widely available
   - This is pure borax or very close
   - **Salvage this in early operations** (Years 0-2) - critical for metalworking
2. **Some soaps and detergents**: May contain borax but mixed with other chemicals
   - Less ideal (impurities can interfere)
3. **Borate mineral deposits** (eventual mining, post-salvage era):
   - Found in dry lake beds, some desert regions (southwestern USA, Turkey, Chile)
   - White/gray crystalline deposits
   - Requires purification

**How to use borax flux**:
1. Heat steel to yellow-orange heat
2. Sprinkle borax powder on joint area
3. Return to forge
4. Heat to white heat (borax melts, flows over surface)
5. Remove from forge, quickly hammer joint together
6. Flux boils off, clean metal surfaces bond

**Borax substitutes (if borax unavailable)**:
- **Sand** (silica): Works but less effective, higher temperature needed
- **Crushed glass**: Similar to sand, very high temperature
- **Wood ash + salt**: Traditional flux, marginal effectiveness
- **Commercial welding flux** (salvaged): If labeled for high-temperature brazing/welding

**Reality**: Borax is so superior to alternatives that forge welding without it is extremely difficult. Make borax salvage a top priority in early salvage operations. A 10 kg box of borax can last years of forge work.

**Storage**:
- Keep dry (absorbs moisture from air)
- Sealed container
- Shelf life: Indefinite if dry

**Arc Welding** (requires electricity):
- Principle: Electric arc (4,000-6,000°C) melts metals together
- Equipment needed:
  - Welding machine: Transforms power to high current (100-200 amps), low voltage (20-30V)
  - Electrode holder and ground clamp
  - Electrodes (consumable rods) or filler wire
  - Helmet with dark glass (arc is blinding and burns skin)
  - Gloves and protective clothing

**Types of Arc Welding**:

1. **Stick Welding (SMAW - Shielded Metal Arc Welding)**:
   - Electrode: Metal rod with flux coating
   - Flux melts, creates gas shield, prevents oxidation
   - Slag forms on top, chip off when cool
   - Most versatile, works outdoors, dirty materials
   - Easiest to improvise

2. **MIG Welding (GMAW - Gas Metal Arc Welding)**:
   - Continuous wire fed from spool
   - Shielding gas (argon or CO2) from tank
   - Faster, cleaner than stick
   - Requires gas supply (can make CO2, see Chapter 4)

3. **TIG Welding (GTAW - Gas Tungsten Arc Welding)**:
   - Non-consumable tungsten electrode
   - Separate filler rod
   - Shielding gas (argon)
   - Most precise, cleanest, strongest welds
   - Difficult to learn, slowest

**Building a Simple Arc Welder**:
- Need: Transformer to step down voltage, increase current
- Salvage from:
  - Microwave oven transformers (2-3 in series)
  - Old welding machines
  - Large industrial transformers
- Circuit: AC power → Transformer → Welding leads
- Safety: Proper grounding, insulated leads, circuit breaker

**Cast Iron Welding/Repair** (Specialized Technique):

Cast iron cannot be arc welded with standard steel electrodes (cracks immediately). Repairing broken cast iron parts requires special methods:

**Method 1: Nickel Rod Welding** (Most Reliable):
- **Electrode**: Pure nickel or nickel-iron rods (salvage from welding supply stores)
  - Look for electrodes labeled "Ni-Rod" or "Cast Iron Repair"
- **Process**:
  1. **Preheat** part to 300-500°C (slow, even heating in forge or oven)
     - Reduces thermal shock, prevents cracking
  2. Weld in short beads (2-3 cm), allow to cool slightly between beads
  3. **Do not overheat** (keeps expansion minimal)
  4. **Cool slowly** (wrap in sand or ash, let cool over hours)
- **Result**: Strong repair, machinable
- **Challenge**: Nickel rods may be unavailable post-collapse, scarce salvage item

**Method 2: Brazing** (More Accessible):
- Heat cast iron to 800-900°C
- Use brass or bronze brazing rod with flux
- Braze joint (fills crack/break with brass)
- **Result**: Moderate strength, good for non-structural repairs
- **Advantage**: More accessible than nickel welding

**Method 3: Mechanical Repair** (No Welding):
- Drill and tap holes across crack
- Install studs or bolts
- Can add epoxy or metal-filled epoxy for sealing
- **Result**: Functional but not elegant

**Reality**: Broken cast iron parts (engine blocks, machine tool bases, heavy housings) are difficult to repair post-collapse. **Prevention is better than repair**—handle cast iron carefully, avoid thermal shock (don't quench hot cast iron in water - cracks it).

**Soldering and Brazing** (Lower Temperature Joining):

**Soldering** (melting point <450°C):
- Filler metal: Solder (traditionally tin-lead, now often tin-copper-silver)
- Heat source: Soldering iron or torch
- Flux: Rosin or acid flux to clean surfaces
- Uses: Electronics, copper plumbing, sheet metal
- Strength: Weak, not for structural loads
- Process:
  1. Clean surfaces
  2. Apply flux
  3. Heat parts with iron
  4. Apply solder, let it flow
  5. Remove heat, hold still until cool

**Brazing** (melting point 450-900°C):
- Filler metal: Brass alloys, bronze, or silver-copper alloys
- Heat source: Torch (propane, MAPP gas, or acetylene)
- Flux: Borax or proprietary flux
- Uses: Joining dissimilar metals, thin to thick, copper pipes
- Strength: Stronger than solder, weaker than welding
- Process: Similar to soldering but higher heat

### Casting (Pouring Molten Metal into Molds)

**Sand Casting** (most accessible method):

**Materials**:
- Sand: Fine sand mixed with clay (5-10% clay content) to hold shape
- Or use "green sand": Sand + bentonite clay + water
- Pattern: Object shape (wood, metal, plastic) to create cavity
- Flask: Frame to hold sand (wood or metal box)
- Crucible: Container to melt metal (see crucible materials below)

**Crucible Materials (Critical Selection)**:

**For copper, brass, bronze**:
- **Iron crucible**: Works fine, cheap, easy to salvage (iron pipe sections, steel cans)
- **Graphite crucible**: Better (longer lasting, smoother pours), harder to find

**For aluminum**:
- **Graphite crucible**: Ideal (aluminum doesn't react with graphite)
- **Ceramic crucible**: Works (clay fired to high temperature)
- **NOT iron/steel crucible**: Iron dissolves into molten aluminum, contaminates it
  - Small amounts acceptable for non-critical parts
  - For electrical or structural aluminum: use graphite or ceramic only

**Salvage sources for graphite crucibles**:
- Welding supply stores
- Metal casting suppliers
- Can be machined from solid graphite blocks (electrodes from electrical systems)

**Making ceramic crucibles**:
- Form from clay (fire clay or high-temperature clay)
- Dry thoroughly
- Fire to high temperature (1,200°C+) in kiln or forge
- Result: Serviceable crucible for aluminum/copper

**Process**:
1. **Make pattern**: Carve or form the shape you want to cast
2. **Pack sand**: Place pattern in flask, pack sand around it firmly
3. **Remove pattern**: Carefully extract pattern, leaving cavity
4. **Create pour spout and vents** (CRITICAL for success):
   - **Pour spout** (sprue): Vertical channel where molten metal enters
   - **Runner**: Horizontal channel from sprue to casting cavity
   - **Vents**: Channels for air/gas to escape

   **Venting is critical**: Inadequate venting causes:
   - Incomplete fills (metal stops before cavity is full)
   - Gas porosity (trapped bubbles, weak casting)
   - Defects and voids

   **Vent placement**:
   - Extend from **high points** of the casting (air rises, collects at top)
   - Small channels (5-10 mm diameter) from top of cavity to surface of sand
   - **Risers**: Vertical vents that also feed shrinkage
     - As metal cools, it shrinks slightly
     - Riser maintains supply of liquid metal to cavity
     - Riser stays liquid longer (greater thermal mass), feeds into casting as it solidifies

   **Rule**: For complex castings, err on side of too many vents. Extra vents don't harm casting, insufficient vents ruin it.

5. **Prepare mold**: Close flask, ready to pour
6. **Melt metal**: Heat in crucible until fully liquid (no lumps)
   - Overheat slightly (50-100°C above melting point) for better flow
7. **Pour**: Carefully pour molten metal into sprue
   - **Steady, continuous pour** (don't stop and start - creates defects)
   - Fill sprue and risers completely
8. **Cool**: Wait for solidification (minutes to hours depending on size)
9. **Break mold**: Remove sand, retrieve casting
10. **Finish**: Grind off imperfections, cut off risers/sprue, machine if needed

**Metals for Casting** (by difficulty):
- Easiest: Lead, tin (low melting point, but lead is toxic)
- Easy: Aluminum (660°C, lightweight)
- Moderate: Copper, brass, bronze (1,000-1,100°C)
- Difficult: Iron (1,538°C, needs blast furnace)

**Lost Wax Casting** (for precision):
1. Carve pattern from wax
2. Cover with clay or plaster
3. Heat: Wax melts out, leaving perfect cavity
4. Pour metal
5. Break mold
- Advantage: Very detailed, smooth finish
- Disadvantage: One-time use (can't reuse mold)

**Permanent Molds**:
- Iron or steel mold (two pieces)
- For repeated castings of same part
- Construction: Machine or cast the mold itself
- Limited to metals with lower melting point than mold (aluminum in iron molds)

## Heat Treating Steel

Steel's properties can be dramatically changed by heating and cooling:

### Annealing (Softening)
**Purpose**: Make steel soft and easy to work
**Process**:
1. Heat to 700-800°C (cherry red)
2. Hold temperature for 15-60 minutes
3. Cool very slowly (in furnace, in sand, or bury in ashes)
**Result**: Soft, not brittle, easy to machine or form

### Hardening
**Purpose**: Make steel hard (for cutting tools, wear surfaces)
**Process**:
1. Heat to 800-900°C (bright red)
2. Quench (plunge) into water, oil, or brine
3. Cool rapidly
**Result**: Very hard, but brittle
**Note**: Only works on medium to high carbon steel (>0.4% carbon)

**Quenching Media**:
- **Water**: Fastest cooling, hardest result, **high risk of cracking**
  - **Use for**: Thick, simple sections (bars, blocks) without intricate shapes
  - **Avoid for**: Thin sections, complex shapes, tools with sharp corners
- **Oil**: Slower cooling, less risk of cracking, slightly softer
  - **Use for**: Thin sections, complex shapes, intricate tools (files, taps, dies)
  - **Types**: Motor oil, vegetable oil, commercial quenching oil
  - **Temperature**: Can be heated to 50-80°C for more uniform quench (reduces cracking further)
- **Brine** (salt water, ~10% salt): Faster than plain water, even higher cracking risk
  - Use only for very thick, simple sections
  - Rarely recommended
- **Air**: Very slow, only for certain alloy steels
  - Most tool steels cannot be hardened by air quenching

**Critical selection guide**:
- **Thin sections and complex shapes should use oil to reduce cracking risk**
- **Water quench only thick, simple sections**
- **Many beginners crack their first hardened tools by using water on intricate shapes**
- If uncertain, use oil—safer, still produces hard steel

### Tempering (Reducing Brittleness)
**Purpose**: After hardening, reduce brittleness while keeping most hardness
**Process**:
1. After hardening and quenching, **clean scale off steel immediately**
   - Wire brush or grind off black scale (oxide layer)
   - Polished steel shows tempering colors clearly
2. **TEMPER IMMEDIATELY** (within hours of quenching)
   - **Critical**: Steel left fully hardened overnight becomes increasingly prone to cracking
   - **Do not delay tempering** - hardened steel is glass-like and brittle, can crack from thermal stress or impact
   - **Temperature cycling** (heating/cooling from room temp) can cause microcracks in untempered hardened steel
3. Gently heat to 200-300°C (observe color changes on clean steel surface)
4. Watch for color (oxide layer forms, indicates temperature):
   - **Pale yellow** (230°C): Very hard, cutting tools (knives, chisels for hardwood)
   - **Straw** (250°C): Hard, drills, taps, punches for metal
   - **Brown** (270°C): Medium hard, punches, rock chisels
   - **Purple** (290°C): Tough, springs, chisels for softer materials
   - **Blue** (320°C): Flexible, swords, large springs
5. **Quench when desired color is reached** (oil or water, doesn't matter at these temperatures)
6. **If color overshoots**: Can re-harden and re-temper, but material waste and grain growth from repeated heating

**Result**: Tougher, less likely to shatter, still hard

**Timing is critical**: Hardening and tempering should happen in the same work session, ideally within 1-2 hours. Do not harden a batch of tools and leave them overnight to temper later—they may crack from residual stresses or minor impacts.

### Case Hardening (Hardening Surface Only)
**Purpose**: Hard surface on soft core (gears, shafts)
**Process**:
1. Pack low-carbon steel in carbon-rich material (charcoal, bone meal)
2. Heat to 900-950°C for hours
3. Carbon diffuses into surface
4. Quench to harden
**Result**: Hard outer layer, tough inner core

## Precision Metalworking

### The Lathe (Most Important Machine Tool)

**What It Does**: Rotates work piece, cutting tool shapes it
**Operations**:
- Turning: Reduce diameter, create cylinders
- Facing: Cut flat ends
- Boring: Enlarge holes
- Threading: Cut screw threads
- Drilling: On-axis holes
- Knurling: Grip patterns

**Basic Components**:
- Bed: Rigid base
- Headstock: Rotates work (motor or hand-crank)
- Tailstock: Supports other end of work
- Carriage: Holds cutting tool, moves along bed
- Cross-slide: Moves cutting tool in/out
- Cutting tool: High-speed steel or carbide

**Salvage Priority**: High. A lathe lets you make precision cylinders, threads, and shafts. You can even use a lathe to help build another lathe.

**Improvising a Lathe**:
- Simplest: Headstock from salvaged motor, tailstock from bearings and pipe
- Bed: Steel channel or welded frame
- Tool rest: Adjustable height platform
- Hand-powered: Crank or treadle instead of motor

### The Milling Machine

**What It Does**: Cutting tool rotates, work piece moves under it
**Operations**:
- Face milling: Flatten surfaces
- End milling: Cut slots, pockets, contours
- Drilling: Precise hole placement
- Gear cutting: With special attachments

**Components**:
- Base and column: Support structure
- Spindle: Rotates cutting tool
- Table: Holds work, moves in X-Y-Z directions
- Cutting tools: End mills, face mills, various shapes

**Salvage Priority**: High, but lower than lathe. Can substitute with drill press and creative fixturing.

### The Drill Press

**What It Does**: Drills precise, perpendicular holes
**Advantages Over Hand Drilling**:
- Accuracy
- Repeatability
- Can use larger bits
- Variable speed

**Salvage Priority**: Medium. Very useful, but hand drills can substitute in early stages.

### Grinding and Precision Finishing

**Surface Grinder**: Flattens surfaces to extreme precision
**Cylindrical Grinder**: Precision diameters
**Tool and Cutter Grinder**: Sharpens cutting tools

**Priority**: Lower in early stages, critical for precision work later

### Measurement Tools

You can't build precision parts without measurement:

**Essential Tools**:
1. **Ruler/Scale**: Basic measurement, 1mm precision at best
2. **Calipers**: Inside/outside/depth measurement, 0.1mm precision
   - Vernier calipers (no power needed)
   - Dial calipers (easier to read)
   - Digital calipers (needs battery)
3. **Micrometer**: Very precise (0.01mm), for critical dimensions
4. **Squares**: Check perpendicularity
5. **Levels**: Check horizontal/vertical
6. **Gauge blocks**: Precision reference standards (salvage if you find them!)

**Salvage Priority**: Critical. These are difficult to make accurately. Preserve any you find.

## Working Specific Metals

### Iron and Steel

**Salvage Sources**: Structural steel, rebar, vehicles, tools
**Working Temperature**: 700-1,100°C (red to orange heat)
**Challenges**: High melting point, rusts easily
**Tips**:
- Keep dry when storing
- Use oil or paint to prevent rust
- Anneal before machining if too hard
- Preheat before welding thick sections

### Copper

**Salvage Sources**: Wire, pipe, electrical components
**Working Temperature**: Can work cold, anneal at 400-600°C
**Challenges**: Work-hardens (gets brittle when hammered)
**Tips**:
- Anneals easily—heat to dull red, quench or air cool
- Excellent for electrical work
- Can be drawn into very fine wire
- Corrosion (green patina) is only surface deep

### Aluminum

**Salvage Sources**: Window frames, siding, vehicles
**Working Temperature**: Room temp to 500°C for forming
**Challenges**:
- **Welding aluminum is extremely difficult** (severely understated in early notes)
- No color change when heated (hard to judge temperature)
- Melts suddenly at 660°C
**Tips**:
- Mark with temperature-indicating crayon if working near melting point
- **Excellent for casting** (low melting point, 660°C easily achievable)
- Very lightweight—good for any mobile applications
- Different alloys have very different properties

**The Aluminum Welding Challenge (Expanded)**:

Aluminum welding is **far more difficult than steel welding**. Most post-collapse communities should **treat aluminum as a casting-only material** until they have sophisticated welding infrastructure.

**Why aluminum is hard to weld**:
1. **Oxide layer**: Aluminum instantly forms aluminum oxide (Al₂O₃) layer in air
   - Oxide melts at 2,072°C (aluminum melts at 660°C)
   - Must remove oxide or weld through it (requires AC current to break up oxide)
2. **No color change**: Can't judge temperature visually—aluminum looks the same cold or near-melting
   - Easy to overheat and melt through
3. **High thermal conductivity**: Heat spreads rapidly, hard to concentrate heat at weld
4. **Porosity**: Molten aluminum absorbs hydrogen from air, creates bubbles/weak welds

**Welding methods that work**:

**TIG Welding (GTAW)** - Only Practical Method:
- **Requirements**:
  - TIG welder with AC capability (for aluminum)
  - Pure argon shielding gas (99.9%+) - CO2 or mixed gases don't work
  - Tungsten electrode (non-consumable)
  - Aluminum filler rod (matching alloy)
- **Technique**: Very precise, requires significant skill
- **Challenge**: Post-collapse availability of pure argon is limited
  - Must salvage argon cylinders (welding supply stores, laboratories)
  - Or produce pure argon (requires cryogenic air separation—advanced infrastructure)

**Specialized Brazing** (Alternative):
- Aluminum brazing alloys (lower melting point than base aluminum)
- Flux designed for aluminum
- Torch-based (propane or MAPP gas)
- **Result**: Lower strength than welding, but achievable
- **Use**: Non-structural joints, repairs

**MIG Welding** (Possible but Difficult):
- Requires aluminum wire, pure argon, special equipment
- Spool gun (pushes wire close to arc, prevents jamming)
- Less precise than TIG
- Still requires argon

**Recommendation for Post-Collapse**:
- **Years 0-20**: Treat aluminum as casting material only
  - Sand cast aluminum parts (easy, low-temperature, effective)
  - Mechanical fastening (bolts, rivets) for joining aluminum pieces
- **Years 20+**: If argon supply secured and TIG welding capability developed, attempt welding
- **Alternative**: Use steel for structures requiring welding, reserve aluminum for cast parts, non-structural components, and applications where light weight is critical (human-powered vehicles, aircraft if attempted)

**Casting aluminum is easy and effective**—focus on that rather than struggling with welding.

### Brass and Bronze

**Salvage Sources**: Fittings, valves, decorative items, bearings
**Working Temperature**: Can work cold or hot (700-800°C)
**Challenges**: Can contain lead (older alloys)
**Tips**:
- Excellent for casting
- Machines beautifully
- Corrosion-resistant
- Good for bearings (bronze especially)

### Lead

**Salvage Sources**: Batteries, wheel weights, old pipes, radiation shielding
**Working Temperature**: Melts at 327°C (very low)
**Challenges**: TOXIC—never heat without ventilation, always wash hands after handling
**Tips**:
- Good for casting small parts (weights, type, bullets)
- Soft—easily formed
- Dense—useful for radiation shielding, counterweights
- Never use lead containers for food or water

## Mining and Refining (Post-Salvage Era)

Eventually, salvage will be depleted. You'll need to mine and refine ore:

### Finding Ores

**Visual Indicators**:
- **Iron**: Red/brown rust colors in rock, heavy black magnetic rocks (magnetite)
- **Copper**: Green staining (malachite), blue staining (azurite)
- **Lead**: Shiny gray metal in rock (galena)
- **Tin**: Black or brown crystals (cassiterite)
- **Aluminum**: Red rock (bauxite)—but very hard to refine

**Old Mines**: Locations where mining occurred before may still have ore

**Stream Panning**: Heavy metals concentrate in stream beds

### Refining Iron from Ore

**Bloomery Furnace** (ancient method, no blast furnace needed):

**Construction**:
- Stone/clay tower, 1-2 meters tall
- Air supply at bottom (bellows or blower)
- Fuel: Charcoal
- Temperature: 1,200-1,300°C

**Process**:
1. Fill furnace with alternating layers of iron ore and charcoal
2. Ignite charcoal, blast air from bottom
3. Iron ore reduces to metallic iron (but doesn't melt)
4. Iron forms spongy "bloom" at bottom
5. Remove bloom (3-5 kg typical)
6. Hammer bloom to squeeze out slag, consolidate iron
7. Repeat hammering and folding to improve quality

**Yield**: Low (50-70% of iron in ore)
**Result**: Wrought iron (low carbon, tough, easily worked)

**Blast Furnace** (more efficient, requires infrastructure):
- Much larger (5-30 meters tall)
- Continuous operation
- Produces molten pig iron (high carbon)
- Requires more sophisticated air blast
- Need to convert pig iron to steel (reduce carbon)

### Refining Copper from Ore

**Smelting Copper**:
1. Crush ore (malachite, azurite, or sulfide ores)
2. Roast sulfide ores to drive off sulfur (produces toxic SO2—do outdoors!)
3. Mix with charcoal and flux (limestone or sand)
4. Heat to 1,200°C in furnace
5. Copper melts, slag floats on top
6. Pour off copper, cast into ingots

**Purity**: May need refining for electrical use
**Refining**: Melt and oxidize impurities, or use electrolysis (needs electrical power)

### Refining Aluminum (Very Difficult)

**Why Difficult**: Aluminum oxide (bauxite) very stable, requires electrolysis at high temperature

**Hall-Héroult Process** (only practical method):
1. Dissolve aluminum oxide in molten cryolite (950°C)
2. Pass huge electric current through solution
3. Aluminum deposits at cathode (negative electrode)
4. Oxygen released at anode (positive electrode)

**Energy Requirement**: Enormous—approximately 15 kWh per kg of aluminum
**Implication**: Don't attempt until you have large-scale electrical generation
**Alternative**: Salvage and recycle aluminum extensively

### Refining Other Metals

**Zinc**: Roast ore, reduce with carbon, distill (boils at 907°C)
**Tin**: Smelt cassiterite ore with carbon (similar to copper)
**Lead**: Smelt galena ore (very easy, low temperature)
**Silver/Gold**: Often found in lead ores, separate by cupellation or chemical methods

## First Projects: Calibrated Challenges for New Metalworkers

New metalworkers need achievable milestones rather than abstract capability descriptions. These projects teach fundamental skills in order of increasing difficulty.

### First Forge Project: Simple Hook or Nail

**Purpose**: Teaches fire control, hammering rhythm, basic shaping

**Materials**: Mild steel rod or salvaged rebar, 10-15 cm length, 6-10 mm diameter

**Process**:
1. Build charcoal fire, maintain bright red heat with bellows
2. Heat steel to orange-red (loses magnetism when hot enough)
3. Place on anvil, hammer one end to point (nail) or curve (hook)
4. Reheat when metal darkens
5. Continue shaping until satisfied
6. Cool slowly (annealing) or quench (if making nail for hardness)

**Skills learned**:
- Temperature judgment (color recognition)
- Hammer control (hitting where you aim)
- Reheating timing (when metal too cold to work)
- Fire management (keeping forge hot)

**Success criteria**: Hook holds shape, nail is pointed, no cracks from cold-working

**Common mistakes**:
- Working metal too cold (hammer bounces, metal cracks) → Reheat more often
- Overheating (metal sparks, burns away) → Remove from fire sooner

---

### First Heat Treating Project: Small Knife or Chisel

**Purpose**: Teaches hardening/tempering cycle, critical for tool-making

**Materials**: Tool steel (leaf spring section), 10-15 cm length

**Process**:
1. Forge rough shape (blade or chisel edge) while steel is soft
2. Grind bevels on edge
3. **Hardening**:
   - Heat to bright red (800-850°C)
   - Quench in oil (blade = oil, thick chisel = water acceptable)
   - Test: File should skate off hardened edge without cutting
4. **Tempering** (immediately after hardening):
   - Clean scale off steel
   - Heat gently (torch or edge of forge)
   - Watch for straw color on edge (250°C)
   - Quench when color appears
5. **Test**: Edge should hold when cutting wood, not chip or roll

**Skills learned**:
- Critical temperature recognition (hardening heat)
- Quench medium selection (oil vs water)
- Tempering color reading
- Immediate sequence (harden → temper, no delay)

**Success criteria**: Blade holds edge when cutting, doesn't chip or crack

**Common mistakes**:
- Water quenching thin blade → cracks (use oil)
- Delaying tempering → blade cracks from brittleness (temper within 1-2 hours)
- Overheating during tempering → blade goes blue (too soft), reharden and try again

---

### First Casting Project: Lead Weight or Ingot

**Purpose**: Teaches mold-making, pouring technique, safety

**Materials**: Lead (salvaged from batteries or wheel weights), sand, flask

**Process**:
1. Make simple pattern (rectangular bar or cylindrical weight)
2. Pack sand around pattern in flask
3. Remove pattern, create pour spout and vent
4. Melt lead in iron crucible (327°C, very low - can use wood fire)
5. Pour steadily into mold
6. Allow to cool (5-10 minutes)
7. Break mold, retrieve casting

**Skills learned**:
- Sand packing (firm but not too hard)
- Pattern removal without collapsing cavity
- Pouring technique (steady, not too fast)
- Safety (molten metal, fumes)

**Success criteria**: Casting fills completely, no major voids, smooth surface

**Common mistakes**:
- Insufficient venting → incomplete fill (add more vents)
- Pouring too slowly → metal solidifies before mold fills (reheat, pour faster)
- Inadequate sand packing → mold collapses during pour (pack firmer)

**Safety**: Lead fumes are toxic. Work outdoors or with ventilation. Wash hands after handling lead.

### First Lathe Project: Simple Cylinder or Handle

**Purpose**: Teaches tool control, precise dimension, surface finish

**Materials**: Mild steel or brass rod, 20-30 mm diameter, 50-100 mm length

**Process**:
1. Mount rod in lathe (chuck or between centers)
2. Set cutting tool at center height
3. Make light cuts (0.5-1 mm depth) along length
4. Measure with calipers after each pass
5. Continue until desired diameter reached
6. Smooth surface with finer cuts

**Skills learned**:
- Tool positioning and sharpness
- Feed rate control (too fast = rough surface, chatter)
- Measurement and precision
- Safety around rotating machinery

**Success criteria**: Cylinder is uniform diameter (±0.2 mm), smooth surface

**Common mistakes**:
- Tool too low/high → poor cut, tool rubbing (adjust tool height to center)
- Cutting too deep → chatter, rough finish (lighter cuts)
- Not measuring → wrong final size (measure frequently)

## Troubleshooting Common Metalworking Failures

Problems arise. Recognizing failure modes and corrections is critical.

### Forging Failures

**Problem: Steel cracks during forging**
- **Cause**: Working metal too cold (below red heat)
- **Fix**: Reheat more often, keep metal bright red, don't force cold metal

**Problem: Metal burns away, sparks fly**
- **Cause**: Overheating (white hot or higher)
- **Fix**: Remove from forge sooner, watch color carefully, reduce air blast slightly

**Problem: Can't achieve welding heat (forge welding)**
- **Cause**: Insufficient air blast or poor charcoal
- **Fix**: Increase bellows pumping, use better charcoal, add more fuel, ensure air pipe not blocked

---

### Heat Treating Failures

**Problem: Steel cracks during quenching**
- **Cause**: Too-rapid quench (water on thin/complex shapes), residual stresses
- **Fix**: Use oil instead of water, preheat quench oil to 50-80°C, simplify shape if possible

**Problem: Steel doesn't harden (file still cuts it after quenching)**
- **Cause 1**: Not hot enough before quench (below critical temperature)
- **Cause 2**: Low-carbon steel (can't be hardened)
- **Fix**: Heat to brighter red before quench, verify steel is tool steel with spark test

**Problem: Hardened tool chips or breaks in use**
- **Cause**: Not tempered, or tempered too cool (still brittle)
- **Fix**: Temper to straw or brown color (250-270°C), more flexibility

---

### Casting Failures

**Problem: Casting has voids and incomplete fills**
- **Cause**: Inadequate venting (air trapped in mold)
- **Fix**: Add more vents from high points of casting to surface, ensure vents aren't blocked by packed sand

**Problem: Casting is porous (full of tiny bubbles)**
- **Cause**: Gas absorption (moisture in mold, impurities in metal)
- **Fix**: Dry sand thoroughly, overheat metal slightly (degasses), pour faster

**Problem: Casting cracks after solidification**
- **Cause**: Constrained shrinkage (mold too rigid, casting design traps stress)
- **Fix**: Use softer-packed sand, redesign casting to reduce stress concentrations

---

### Welding Failures

**Problem: Welds crack after cooling**
- **Cause 1**: Welding thick sections without preheat (thermal shock)
- **Cause 2**: Wrong electrode (low-hydrogen electrodes needed for thick steel)
- **Fix**: Preheat thick sections to 100-200°C, use correct electrodes, reduce cooling rate (cover weld with insulating material)

**Problem: Forge welds won't stick**
- **Cause 1**: Not hot enough (need white heat, ~1,300°C)
- **Cause 2**: Insufficient flux (surfaces oxidized)
- **Cause 3**: Not hammering fast enough (surfaces cool before bonding)
- **Fix**: Hotter fire, more borax flux, clean surfaces before heating, hammer immediately when removed from forge

**Problem: Arc weld has porosity (visible holes in bead)**
- **Cause**: Contaminated base metal (rust, oil, paint), moisture in electrode
- **Fix**: Clean metal thoroughly (grind to bare metal), dry electrodes in oven (100°C for 1 hour), use fresh electrode

## Precision Measurement Tools: Guard Them Carefully

**Critical note**: Precision measurement tools (calipers, micrometers, gauge blocks, squares) require metalworking capability to maintain. These tools need occasional recalibration, cleaning, and careful handling.

**Reality**: **You can make a new hammer, but you cannot easily make a new micrometer.**

**Preservation priority**:
- **Calipers and micrometers**: Salvage any found, protect from rust and damage
- **Gauge blocks**: If you find a set (precision reference standards), guard them like gold
- **Dial indicators**: Delicate, valuable for precision work
- **Squares and levels**: Can be made, but salvaged ones are usually more accurate

**Maintenance**:
- Keep dry (oil lightly to prevent rust)
- Handle carefully (dropping micrometer can damage precision)
- Clean after use (wipe off metal dust and chips)
- Store in cases or wrapped in cloth
- Never use as hammer or pry bar

**Calibration**:
- Gauge blocks are standards (use to check calipers/micrometers)
- If no gauge blocks: Compare measurements between tools
- Precision degrades over time (worn anvils on micrometers, bent caliper jaws)

**When precision tools are lost or broken**: You're back to cruder measurements (rulers, comparison). Precision manufacturing becomes extremely difficult.

**Treat precision tools as irreplaceable resources. Protect the specialists who know how to use them.** See Chapter -1 on knowledge triage—a specialist who can use a micrometer accurately is worth their weight in copper.

## Cross-Reference: Agricultural Tools Require Metalworking

**The agricultural tools described in Chapter 0.5**—plows, hoes, scythes, sickles—**all require the forging and heat treating techniques covered in this chapter.**

**Connection**:
- **Chapter 0.5** explains why you need these tools (agriculture enables surplus, surplus enables specialization)
- **This chapter** explains how to make and repair those tools (forging, hardening, tempering)

**Specific techniques required**:
- **Plow blade**: Forge from mild steel, harden cutting edge if using high-carbon steel insert
- **Hoe and scythe**: Forge and harden edge, temper to prevent brittleness
- **Sickle**: Curve requires hot forming, edge requires hardening/tempering
- **Axe**: Complex forging (folding eye, shaping head), edge hardening critical

**Timeline integration**:
- **Years 0-2**: Salvage tools (Chapter 1) and basic repair (this chapter)
- **Years 2-5**: Forge replacement tools as salvage wears out (this chapter)
- **Years 5-10**: Manufacture new tools for expanding agriculture (this chapter enables Chapter 0.5 expansion)

**Forward reference**: Agricultural tool-making is covered in practical examples in Chapter 0.5 (what tools), with metalworking techniques from this chapter (how to make them).

**Backward reference from Chapter 0.5**: "The plow construction and blade sharpening described here assumes metalworking capability from Chapter 2."

2. Construct electrical generators (Chapter 3)
3. Create chemical processing equipment (Chapter 4)
4. Manufacture electronic components (Chapter 5)

Metalworking is the foundation. Master it, and you can build almost anything.

**Key Takeaway**: Start with salvaged metals and simple techniques. Build skill and infrastructure gradually. Don't attempt to mine and refine until you've exhausted salvage and developed expertise with the material.
