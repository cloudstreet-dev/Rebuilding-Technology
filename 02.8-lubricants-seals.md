# Chapter 2.8: Lubricants and Seals

## The Unglamorous Truth

This is the least exciting chapter in this book. It's also one of the most important.

You can design the most brilliant machine ever conceived. You can forge perfect gears, craft precision shafts, and build a mechanical masterpiece that would make Leonardo da Vinci weep with envy. None of it matters if your bearings seize after three days of operation.

Lubrication is boring. Seals are mundane. And the lack of both kills more machinery than any other single cause in human history.

In the first decades after collapse, you'll see this pattern repeat endlessly: Someone rebuilds a mill, a pump, a lathe. It runs beautifully. Everyone celebrates. Two weeks later, it's a frozen lump of scrap metal because nobody thought about lubrication.

The Romans understood this. Every Roman water mill had a slave whose sole job was to check oil levels and grease bearings. Not because the Romans were obsessed with lubricants - because they learned, through destroyed machinery, that this unglamorous work was absolutely critical.

**The hard truth:** More post-collapse machinery will fail from inadequate lubrication than from poor design, bad materials, and operator error combined. This chapter might save more of your infrastructure than any other knowledge in this book.

Don't skip it because it's boring. Read it because it's vital.

## Why Lubricants Matter

When metal moves against metal, friction generates heat. Without lubrication:

- **Friction increases:** Moving parts generate enormous resistance
- **Heat builds up:** Temperatures can exceed the melting point of the metal
- **Surfaces weld together:** Microscopic high points actually fuse
- **Seizure occurs:** The machine locks up permanently
- **Rapid wear:** Even if seizure doesn't happen, parts wear away in hours instead of years

A good lubricant performs six critical functions:

### 1. Reduce Friction
Creates a film between moving surfaces, preventing direct metal-to-metal contact. This can reduce friction coefficients from 0.3-0.5 (dry) to 0.01-0.05 (lubricated) - a reduction of 90-95%.

### 2. Dissipate Heat
Lubricants absorb heat from friction and carry it away. In an engine, oil can remove 40% of the total heat generated.

### 3. Prevent Corrosion
Forms a protective barrier against moisture and oxygen. A thin film of oil prevents rust that would otherwise destroy precision surfaces in days.

### 4. Seal Clearances
Fills microscopic gaps between parts, preventing leaks and maintaining compression (critical in engines).

### 5. Carry Away Contaminants
Flushes metal particles, dust, and combustion residues away from critical surfaces. Clean oil is happy oil.

### 6. Cushion Shock Loads
Acts as a hydraulic cushion during sudden impacts or load changes, protecting gears and bearings from damage.

**Miss any of these functions and your machinery dies.** This isn't hyperbole - it's mechanical reality.

## Natural and Salvaged Lubricants

In the early post-collapse period, you'll work with what you can find or make. Understanding the properties and limitations of each option is critical.

### Animal Fats (Tallow, Lard)

**Source:** Rendered from beef (tallow), pork (lard), or other animal fat.

**Properties:**
- Available wherever you butcher animals
- Decent lubrication at low temperatures and speeds
- Water-resistant when properly rendered
- Free byproduct of meat processing

**Applications:**
- Cart and wagon wheel bearings (low speed)
- Hand tools (saws, planes)
- Leather treatment (softening, waterproofing)
- Emergency lubricant for almost anything slow-moving

**Critical Limitations:**
- **Rancidity:** Oxidizes over time, becoming acidic and corrosive
- **Temperature:** Breaks down above 200°F (93°C)
- **Attraction:** Draws rodents and insects
- **Consistency:** Changes dramatically with temperature
- **Shelf life:** Months, not years

**The Rancidity Problem:**
This is the killer. Animal fats oxidize when exposed to air, developing free fatty acids that corrode metal. A bearing lubricated with fresh tallow works fine. The same bearing six months later can be etched and pitted from acidic degradation.

**Solution:** Use animal fats for applications where you can replace them frequently (weekly to monthly). Never use them for sealed bearings or long-term storage applications.

### Vegetable Oils

Not all plant oils are equal. Each has specific properties that make it better or worse for different applications.

#### Linseed Oil (Flax Seed)
- **Property:** Drying oil (polymerizes when exposed to air)
- **Use:** Protective coatings, wood treatment
- **Lubricant rating:** Poor - turns into varnish
- **Application:** Rust prevention (coat idle tools), wood preservation

#### Rapeseed Oil (Canola)
- **Property:** Non-drying, stable
- **Use:** General light lubrication
- **Lubricant rating:** Good for low-speed applications
- **Application:** Clocks, light machinery, spinning wheels

#### Castor Oil
- **Property:** Very viscous, polar molecules (sticks to metal)
- **Use:** High-temperature, high-speed applications
- **Lubricant rating:** Excellent
- **Application:** Engine oil (historically used in aircraft), racing engines
- **Note:** Early racing cars used castor oil exclusively. It works, but it's expensive to produce in quantity.

#### Olive Oil
- **Property:** Relatively stable, moderate viscosity
- **Use:** Light machinery, tools
- **Lubricant rating:** Fair
- **Application:** Emergency lubricant, better used for eating

**General Vegetable Oil Limitations:**
- **Oxidation:** All eventually go rancid (slower than animal fats)
- **Temperature:** Most break down above 250°F
- **Gumming:** Can polymerize, leaving sticky residue
- **Cost:** In post-collapse, edible oils are valuable as food

**Practical Reality:** You'll use vegetable oils because they're available, not because they're ideal. They work adequately for low-speed, low-temperature applications. Don't expect miracles.

### Mineral Oil (Petroleum-Based)

This is liquid gold. Literally prioritize hoarding this above almost anything else.

**Sources (Pre-Collapse Stock):**
- Motor oil (SAE 10W-30, 20W-50, etc.)
- Automatic transmission fluid (ATF)
- Gear oil (80W-90, 85W-140)
- Hydraulic oil
- Compressor oil
- Turbine oil

**Properties:**
- **Stable:** Doesn't oxidize like organic oils
- **Temperature range:** Functional from -40°F to 400°F depending on grade
- **Viscosity options:** Thin (10W) to thick (140W)
- **Additives:** Modern oils contain detergents, anti-wear compounds, corrosion inhibitors
- **Shelf life:** Decades if stored properly (sealed, cool, dark)

**Storage Guidelines:**
- Keep sealed in original containers
- Store in cool, dark location
- Plastic containers are fine (oil doesn't degrade HDPE)
- Rotate stock if possible (use oldest first)
- **Expect:** 20-30 years minimum shelf life for sealed containers
- **Reality:** 50+ year old oil, if stored well, is often still usable

**Salvage Priority:**
If you can only save one thing from the old world, save petroleum lubricants. You can make substitutes for almost everything else. You cannot easily replicate modern motor oil in a post-collapse environment.

A barrel of 20W-50 motor oil might keep a critical mill running for twenty years. That's worth more than gold.

### Graphite (Dry Lubricant)

**Source:** Natural mineral (soft carbon form), salvage from electrical equipment (brushes), pencils, or direct mining.

**Properties:**
- Slippery crystalline structure (layers slide over each other)
- Functional from -400°F to 1200°F
- Doesn't oxidize or degrade
- Works in vacuum (wet lubricants boil off)
- No moisture required (unlike molybdenum disulfide)

**Applications:**
- High-temperature bearings (ovens, kilns)
- Locks and hinges
- Chain lubrication (mixed with oil)
- Drawing dies
- Electrical contacts (conductive)
- Emergency dry lubricant

**Forms:**
- **Powder:** Mix with oil or grease as additive
- **Paste:** Graphite + oil/grease for manual application
- **Dry:** Dust onto surfaces (less effective but useful)

**Limitations:**
- Not suitable for high-speed bearings (abrasive)
- Conductive (don't use where electrical insulation needed)
- Messy (black dust everywhere)

**Practical Use:** Graphite excels where conventional lubricants fail. High heat, contaminated environments, or anywhere you can't maintain a clean oil film. Keep a supply.

### Molybdenum Disulfide (MoS2)

If you find this, save it. It's rare post-collapse but incredibly useful.

**Properties:**
- Similar to graphite (layered crystal structure)
- Extremely low friction coefficient
- Functional -400°F to 750°F
- Better than graphite for high-pressure applications
- Non-conductive (unlike graphite)

**Sources:**
- Salvage from specialty greases
- Mining (molybdenite ore) - unlikely post-collapse
- Military equipment lubricants

**Applications:**
- Heavy load bearings
- Gears under extreme pressure
- Dry film lubricant for sliding surfaces

**Reality Check:** You probably won't have this. If you do, use it sparingly for critical applications where nothing else works.

## Grease Making

Grease is just thick oil - a lubricant that stays where you put it. For most machinery (bearings, gears, slides), grease is superior to oil because it doesn't drip away.

**Basic Formula:**
```
Grease = Base Oil + Thickener + Additives (optional)
```

The thickener forms a sponge-like structure that traps the oil. When sheared (rubbed), grease releases oil to lubricate. When at rest, it stays in place.

### Thickener Options

#### 1. Soap-Based Thickeners (Most Practical)

**Calcium Soap (Lime + Fat):**
- Water-resistant
- Temperature limit: ~160°F
- Applications: Wheel bearings, general purpose

**Lithium Soap:**
- Water-resistant
- Temperature limit: ~350°F
- Applications: Modern general-purpose grease
- **Problem:** Requires lithium hydroxide (harder to source post-collapse)

**Sodium Soap (Caustic Soda + Fat):**
- NOT water-resistant
- Temperature limit: ~180°F
- Applications: Dry environments only
- **Advantage:** Easy to make (lye is simple to produce)

#### 2. Clay-Based Thickeners
- Bentonite or other clays
- Temperature limit: ~400°F
- Applications: High-temperature bearings
- **Problem:** Difficult to process without modern equipment

### Calcium Grease Recipe (Achievable Post-Collapse)

This is your practical, make-it-yourself grease. Not ideal, but functional and achievable with pre-industrial technology.

**Materials:**
- Base oil (petroleum if available, heavy vegetable oil if not)
- Fat (tallow, lard, or vegetable oil) - ~15-20% by weight
- Quicklime (calcium oxide, CaO) - ~3-5% by weight
- Water

**Equipment:**
- Heat source (fire)
- Heavy pot or kettle (cast iron acceptable)
- Stirring implement (wooden paddle)
- Thermometer (if available, not critical)
- Containers for storage

**Procedure:**

1. **Prepare the Lime:**
   - Slake quicklime with small amount of water
   - Exothermic reaction (gets hot)
   - Let cool slightly
   - You want a paste, not liquid

2. **Heat the Oil:**
   - Add base oil to pot
   - Heat to ~180-200°F (just below boiling water temperature)
   - Don't overheat (oil can ignite above 400°F)

3. **Saponification:**
   - Add fat to hot oil, stir until melted
   - Slowly add lime paste while stirring constantly
   - Continue heating and stirring
   - **Reaction time:** 30-60 minutes
   - Mixture will thicken, turn opaque, become soap-like

4. **Water Addition:**
   - Add small amounts of water (5-10% total)
   - Stir thoroughly
   - This stabilizes the grease structure

5. **Finishing:**
   - Continue heating and stirring until uniform
   - Test consistency: Scoop out sample, let cool
   - Should be thick paste, not liquid or crumbly
   - If too thin: Add more lime-fat mixture
   - If too thick: Add more base oil

6. **Cooling and Storage:**
   - Pour into containers while warm
   - Stir occasionally while cooling (prevents separation)
   - Seal containers to prevent water contamination

**Properties of Calcium Grease:**
- Consistency: Soft to medium (NLGI 1-2 grade equivalent)
- Water resistance: Good
- Temperature range: 0°F to 160°F
- Applications: Cart bearings, slow machinery, slides
- Shelf life: Months (depends on base oil quality)

**Troubleshooting:**
- **Too runny:** Insufficient thickener or wrong temperature
- **Lumpy:** Uneven mixing or lime not properly slaked
- **Separates:** Insufficient reaction time or wrong proportions
- **Harsh/grainy:** Excess lime or impurities

**Reality Check:** This grease won't match Valvoline. It's primitive, it has limitations, and it needs replacement more often than modern grease. But it works, and you can make it with early-stage technology.

Use it or watch your bearings destroy themselves. The choice is obvious.

### Applications for Homemade Grease

**Good For:**
- Wheel bearings (carts, wagons, millstones)
- Plain bearings (sleeve bearings in slow machinery)
- Open gears (large, slow-moving)
- Slides and ways (machine tool surfaces)
- General chassis lubrication

**Not Good For:**
- High-speed ball bearings (modern vehicle wheels)
- High-temperature applications (exhaust bearings, oven doors)
- Precision machinery requiring clean lubrication
- Long intervals between regreasing (months to years)

**Maintenance:** Plan to regrease every 3-6 months for regular use. More often in wet or dirty conditions.

## Petroleum Salvage and Refining

If you have access to crude oil (natural seeps, old wells, salvaged drums), you can produce your own lubricants. This is advanced, dangerous, and requires significant infrastructure - but it's achievable and valuable.

### Finding Petroleum

**Natural Sources:**
- **Oil seeps:** Places where oil naturally reaches surface
- **Historical oil fields:** Most are depleted but often still produce small amounts
- **Tar pits:** Heavy crude at surface
- **Rock outcrops:** Some sedimentary rocks contain extractable oil

**Signs of Oil:**
- Rainbow sheen on water
- Black or brown staining on rocks
- Sticky tar-like deposits
- Sulfurous smell
- Historical records of drilling activity

**Reality:** Most "easy" oil was extracted pre-collapse. What remains requires drilling (covered in other chapters) or is low-grade seep oil. Small quantities are still valuable.

### Crude Oil Distillation

Crude oil is a mixture of hydrocarbons with different boiling points. Heating and condensing at specific temperatures separates these fractions.

**Fractions (by boiling range):**

1. **Light Naphtha:** 20-90°C (68-194°F)
   - Solvents, gasoline components
   - Highly flammable

2. **Gasoline:** 40-200°C (104-392°F)
   - Fuel for spark-ignition engines
   - Most volatile useful fraction

3. **Kerosene:** 150-270°C (302-518°F)
   - Lamp fuel, diesel fuel, jet fuel
   - Good solvent

4. **Diesel/Gas Oil:** 200-350°C (392-662°F)
   - Diesel fuel
   - Light heating oil

5. **Lubricating Oil:** 300-450°C (572-842°F)
   - Motor oil base stock
   - **This is what you want for lubrication**

6. **Heavy Gas Oil/Bitumen:** 450°C+ (842°F+)
   - Asphalt, tar
   - Fuel oil (heavy)
   - Roofing, waterproofing

### Simple Refinery Construction

**Warning:** This process involves flammable liquids and high temperatures. Fire and explosion risks are real. Build away from inhabited areas. Have firefighting equipment ready.

**Basic Equipment:**

**1. Distillation Vessel (Still)**
- Large metal pot or drum (50+ gallons)
- Heat source (fire pit, furnace)
- Sealed top with vapor outlet
- Temperature measurement (critical)

**2. Condenser**
- Copper or stainless tube (long, coiled)
- Water jacket (cold water flowing around tube)
- Vapor enters hot end, liquid drips from cold end

**3. Collection System**
- Multiple containers for different fractions
- Switchable output (change containers as temperature rises)

**4. Heat Source**
- Wood fire (traditional, hard to control temperature)
- Coal fire (hotter, more consistent)
- Gas burner (if natural gas available - best option)

**Simple Procedure:**

1. **Fill Still:**
   - Add crude oil (half-full maximum, allow expansion)
   - Never fill completely (boilover risk)

2. **Heat Gradually:**
   - Start with low heat
   - Increase slowly (1-2 hours to reach first fraction)
   - Monitor temperature constantly

3. **Collect Fractions:**
   - 40-200°C: Gasoline (light ends)
     - Change container every 20°C for better separation
   - 200-300°C: Kerosene/diesel
   - 300-450°C: **Lubricating oil fraction**
     - This is your goal
     - Thick, viscous, amber to brown liquid
   - 450°C+: Stop (risk of cracking, fire)

4. **Shutdown:**
   - Remove heat source
   - Allow still to cool slowly
   - **Do not open while hot**
   - Residue (asphalt/tar) remains in still

**Quality Issues:**

Raw distilled lubricating oil is crude. It contains:
- Sulfur compounds (corrosive)
- Unsaturated hydrocarbons (oxidize easily)
- Particulates (ash, carbon)

**Basic Refining:**
- **Settling:** Let stand for weeks, decant clear oil
- **Filtration:** Pass through sand, charcoal, cloth
- **Acid treatment:** Mix with sulfuric acid, separates contaminants (advanced, dangerous)
- **Clay treatment:** Filter through clay to remove impurities

**Achievable Quality:** Your distilled and filtered oil will be inferior to pre-collapse motor oil. Expect:
- Shorter lifespan (change more frequently)
- More carbon buildup
- Lower temperature tolerance
- More corrosion

But it's oil. Real petroleum oil. That makes it worth 100x its weight in animal fat.

### Safety (Critical)

**Fire Hazards:**
- All petroleum fractions are flammable
- Vapors are explosive in enclosed spaces
- Flash point (ignition temperature) decreases with lighter fractions
- **Gasoline vapor + spark = explosion**

**Safety Measures:**
- Outdoor operation only
- No open flames near collection area
- Vapor control (vent away from heat source)
- Fire extinguishing equipment (sand, water, blankets)
- Multiple operators (don't work alone)

**Toxicity:**
- Petroleum vapors cause dizziness, nausea, unconsciousness
- Skin contact causes dermatitis (long-term)
- Ingestion is fatal
- Chronic exposure causes cancer (long-term risk)

**Protective Measures:**
- Work upwind of vapors
- Gloves for handling (leather or rubber)
- Wash exposed skin thoroughly
- Don't eat, drink, or smoke while working

**Reality:** People will die learning to do this. Explosions, fires, and toxic exposure are inevitable as knowledge is relearned. Minimize risk through careful procedure, but accept that petroleum refining is inherently dangerous.

The value of the product justifies the risk - but respect the danger.

## Lubricant Selection by Application

Choosing the wrong lubricant destroys machinery as surely as using no lubricant. Each application has specific requirements.

### Journal Bearings (Plain/Sleeve Bearings)

**Description:** Shaft rotates inside a cylindrical bushing. No rolling elements, pure sliding contact.

**Lubrication Requirements:**
- Continuous oil film between shaft and bearing
- Sufficient viscosity to maintain film under load
- Low enough viscosity to allow rotation

**Lubricant Choice:**
- **Low speed (<100 RPM):** Heavy grease or thick oil (SAE 50, 60)
- **Medium speed (100-1000 RPM):** Medium oil (SAE 20, 30)
- **High speed (>1000 RPM):** Light oil (SAE 10, 20)
- **Heavy load:** Increase viscosity one grade

**Delivery Method:**
- Grease cup (packed grease, occasional replenishment)
- Oil hole with wick (slow feed)
- Drip oiler (continuous slow drops)
- Pressure system (pumped) - advanced

**Failure Mode:** Inadequate film thickness causes metal-to-metal contact. Bearing wears rapidly, heats, seizes.

### Rolling Element Bearings (Ball/Roller Bearings)

**Description:** Balls or rollers between inner and outer race. Rolling contact instead of sliding.

**Lubrication Requirements:**
- Prevent metal contact between rolling elements and races
- Reduce friction in sliding contact areas (cages, race shoulders)
- Protect against corrosion
- Minimal lubricant (too much causes churning, heat)

**Lubricant Choice:**
- **Preferred:** Medium consistency grease (NLGI 2-3)
- **Alternative:** Light oil (only if sealed or continuous feed)
- **High speed:** Light grease or oil-mist system
- **High load:** Grease with extreme-pressure (EP) additives

**Critical:** Ball bearings are precision devices. Contamination kills them. Keep lubricant clean.

**Failure Mode:** Inadequate lubrication causes brinelling (indentations), spalling (surface flaking), overheating, seizure.

**Salvage Priority:** Modern ball bearings are difficult to manufacture. Salvage and preserve them. A good bearing, properly lubricated, lasts decades. The same bearing, poorly lubricated, lasts weeks.

### Gears (Enclosed)

**Description:** Toothed wheels meshing in a sealed housing (gearbox).

**Lubrication Requirements:**
- Withstand high contact pressures (tooth faces)
- Prevent pitting and scuffing
- Carry away wear particles
- Dissipate heat

**Lubricant Choice:**
- **Spur/helical gears:** Heavy oil (SAE 80W, 90)
- **Worm gears:** Very heavy oil or EP gear oil (90W, 140W)
- **High-speed gears:** Lighter oil (prevents churning)
- **Heavy loads:** Add EP additives if available (sulfur-phosphorus compounds)

**Delivery Method:**
- Splash lubrication (gears dip in oil bath)
- Spray lubrication (pump-fed) - for high speed

**Oil Level:** Critical. Too low = inadequate lubrication. Too high = churning, heat, power loss.

**Failure Mode:** Insufficient lubrication causes tooth surface damage (pitting, scuffing), accelerated wear, tooth breakage.

### Gears (Open)

**Description:** Exposed gears, no housing. Common in windmills, mills, large machinery.

**Lubrication Requirements:**
- Stay on gear teeth (doesn't fling off)
- Resist contamination (dust, water)
- Protect against weather

**Lubricant Choice:**
- **Preferred:** Very thick grease (NLGI 2-3) with tackiness additives
- **Alternative:** Graphite paste
- **Low-tech:** Tallow or heavy grease (requires frequent reapplication)

**Application:** Manual, brushed or daubed onto teeth regularly.

**Maintenance:** Weekly to monthly application, depending on conditions.

**Failure Mode:** Lubricant flings off or washes away. Gears wear rapidly, teeth break.

### Chains

**Description:** Articulated links, high contact pressure at pins.

**Lubrication Requirements:**
- Penetrate into pin/bushing interface
- Resist being flung off by centrifugal force
- Protect against corrosion

**Lubricant Choice:**
- **Low speed:** Heavy oil or thin grease
- **High speed:** Light oil (SAE 10, 20)
- **Dirty environment:** Graphite paste or dry graphite
- **Exposed to weather:** Water-resistant grease

**Application:**
- Drip oil onto top of chain (gravity feeds into links)
- Brush grease manually
- Soak chain in oil bath (removal required)

**Critical:** Chains need internal lubrication (at pins), not just external coating.

**Failure Mode:** Dry chain wears rapidly at pins, stretches (pitch increases), eventually breaks.

### Slides and Ways (Machine Tool Surfaces)

**Description:** Flat surfaces sliding against each other, often with heavy loads (machine tool beds, carriages).

**Lubrication Requirements:**
- High viscosity (stays in place under vertical load)
- Tackiness (doesn't squeeze out)
- Smooth motion (prevent stick-slip)

**Lubricant Choice:**
- **Preferred:** Way oil (thick, tacky, purpose-made)
- **Alternative:** Heavy oil (SAE 50, 60) with tackiness additives
- **Low-tech:** Heavy grease (wiped on surface)

**Application:**
- Hand-wiped before use
- Drip oiler (continuous feed)
- Pressure system (pumped) - advanced

**Failure Mode:** Insufficient lubrication causes stick-slip (jerky motion), galling (surface tearing), rapid wear.

### Wire Rope

**Description:** Steel cables under tension, flexing over sheaves.

**Lubrication Requirements:**
- Penetrate into core (between strands)
- Protect against corrosion
- Remain during outdoor exposure

**Lubricant Choice:**
- **Preferred:** Wire rope grease (thin consistency, penetrating)
- **Alternative:** Heavy oil mixed with graphite
- **Low-tech:** Tallow or lard (frequent reapplication)

**Application:**
- Brush or wipe onto rope
- Pass rope through grease-filled container

**Critical:** Rope needs internal lubrication. Outer coating alone is insufficient.

**Failure Mode:** Dry rope corrodes internally (invisible), individual wires break, sudden catastrophic failure under load.

### Engines (Internal Combustion)

**Description:** Reciprocating pistons, rotating crankshaft, high temperatures, combustion contamination.

**Lubrication Requirements:**
- Maintain film under high pressures
- Withstand temperatures (200-400°F in crankcase)
- Neutralize combustion acids
- Suspend carbon and soot
- Flow at cold temperatures (starting)

**Lubricant Choice:**
- **Modern engine:** Use salvaged motor oil (10W-30, 20W-50)
- **Older/slower engine:** Straight-weight oil (SAE 30, 40)
- **No petroleum:** Castor oil (works but expensive)
- **Desperate:** Heavy vegetable oil (very short lifespan)

**Delivery Method:**
- Pressure lubrication (oil pump) - standard
- Splash lubrication (dippers on connecting rods) - older designs

**Oil Changes:**
- **Petroleum oil:** Every 50-100 hours (sooner if contaminated)
- **Vegetable oil:** Every 10-20 hours
- **Filtration:** Extends life significantly (strain through cloth)

**Critical:** Engines are the most demanding lubrication application. Use the best oil you have. Change it regularly. Filter it if possible.

**Failure Mode:** Inadequate lubrication causes bearing failure (connecting rod, main bearings), piston seizure, valve damage. Engine destruction in minutes to hours.

**Reality:** Keeping engines running post-collapse depends more on lubrication than any other factor. An engine with adequate oil, changed regularly, runs for thousands of hours. The same engine with poor oil management dies quickly.

Prioritize engine oil above almost any other resource. A running engine is worth its weight in food.

## Seals and Gaskets

Seals keep lubricants in and contaminants out. Without effective sealing, your carefully chosen lubricant leaks away or becomes contaminated in days.

### Why Seals Matter

**Leakage:**
- Wastes precious lubricant
- Creates fire hazards (oil drips on hot surfaces)
- Makes mess (attracts dirt)

**Contamination:**
- Water enters, emulsifies oil (milky, ineffective)
- Dust enters, creates abrasive paste (rapid wear)
- Loss of lubricant properties

**Pressure Loss:**
- Hydraulic systems lose pressure
- Pneumatic systems lose air
- Engines lose compression

**A seal is not optional.** It's as critical as the lubricant itself.

### Natural Rubber

**Source:** Latex from rubber trees (Hevea brasiliensis), primarily tropical regions. See Chapter 4 for extraction methods.

**Properties (Raw):**
- Elastic
- Waterproof
- Degrades with heat and ozone
- Becomes brittle with age

**Vulcanization (Critical Improvement):**
Process of heating rubber with sulfur. Creates cross-links between polymer chains.

**Benefits:**
- Temperature range expands: -40°F to 250°F (vs -10°F to 150°F raw)
- Resists degradation
- Maintains elasticity
- Longer lifespan (years vs months)

**Basic Vulcanization:**
1. Mix raw rubber with sulfur (2-5% by weight)
2. Heat to 250-280°F for 15-60 minutes
3. Result: Vulcanized rubber (harder, more durable)

**Applications:**
- O-rings
- Lip seals
- Gaskets
- Hoses

**Limitation:** Rubber trees are tropical. If you're outside their range, rubber is a valuable trade good, not a local product.

### Leather

**Source:** Tanned animal hide (cow, pig, horse). Vegetable tanning (with oak bark tannins) produces best sealing leather.

**Properties:**
- Flexible when properly treated
- Compressible
- Absorbs oil (good for lubricated seals)
- Durable with maintenance

**Preparation for Seals:**
- Use thick leather (3-5mm)
- Oil-tan or vegetable-tan (not chrome-tan)
- Keep supple with regular oiling

**Applications:**
- Cup seals (pump plungers)
- Gaskets (low pressure)
- Packing (shafts)
- Diaphragms

**Maintenance:**
- Keep oiled (prevents drying, cracking)
- Replace when stiff or cracked
- Store in cool, dry conditions

**Failure Mode:** Leather dries out, becomes stiff, cracks, leaks. Regular oiling prevents this.

### Cork

**Source:** Bark of cork oak tree (Quercus suber), Mediterranean region. Salvage from bottle stoppers, gaskets, insulation.

**Properties:**
- Compressible (conforms to irregular surfaces)
- Resilient (returns to shape)
- Impermeable
- Resistant to oil, gasoline

**Applications:**
- Gaskets (valve covers, oil pans)
- Bottle stoppers
- Vibration dampening

**Preparation:**
- Cut to shape with knife or punch
- Soak in oil (improves sealing)
- Compress during installation (maintains pressure)

**Limitation:** Cork grows only in specific climates. You can't make it - only salvage and reuse it.

### Fiber Gaskets

**Source:** Compressed plant fiber (paper), often impregnated with oil or graphite.

**Properties:**
- Cheap to make
- Conforms to surfaces
- Adequate for low-pressure applications
- Not durable (single-use)

**Making Fiber Gaskets:**
1. Obtain thick paper or cardboard
2. Soak in oil or thin oil-graphite mixture
3. Dry partially (still pliable)
4. Cut to shape
5. Install while slightly oil-saturated

**Applications:**
- Engine gaskets (valve cover, oil pan) - low pressure
- Pump housings
- Gearbox covers
- Any flat-flange static seal

**Not Suitable For:**
- High temperature (burns)
- High pressure (blows out)
- Cylinder head gaskets (use metal or composite)

**Reality:** Fiber gaskets are disposable. Make them as needed, replace frequently. They're adequate but not ideal.

### Rope Packing

**Source:** Natural fiber rope (hemp, flax, cotton) impregnated with lubricant.

**Properties:**
- Flexible
- Compressible (stuffs into packing glands)
- Absorbs lubricant
- Inexpensive

**Preparation:**
1. Obtain rope (1/4" to 1" diameter depending on application)
2. Soak in hot tallow, graphite paste, or heavy grease
3. Dry slightly (pliable, not dripping)
4. Cut to length

**Applications:**
- Shaft packing (rotating shafts through walls)
- Valve stems
- Pump stuffing boxes
- Piston rod packing (steam engines)

**Installation:**
- Wind into packing gland in overlapping layers
- Compress with packing nut
- Adjust compression (should seep slightly, not leak freely)

**Maintenance:**
- Tighten packing nut as packing compresses
- Replace when adjustment runs out (quarterly to annually)

**Critical Understanding:** Packing is supposed to leak a little. A small weep lubricates the packing and prevents overheating. Zero leakage = too tight = seized shaft or burned packing.

### Felt

**Source:** Compressed wool fibers, matted together. Make from raw wool or salvage from insulation, crafts.

**Properties:**
- Absorbs oil
- Soft (doesn't damage shafts)
- Creates wiping action
- Self-lubricating when oil-saturated

**Applications:**
- Wiper seals (keeps dirt out)
- Light oil seals (low pressure)
- Bearing retainers (holds oil in bearing)
- Dust excluders

**Installation:**
- Cut to shape (washer or strip)
- Soak in oil
- Install with light compression

**Not Suitable For:**
- High pressure
- High temperature
- Water sealing

**Function:** Felt doesn't create a perfect seal. It wipes shafts, retains oil, and excludes coarse dirt. For precision sealing, use rubber or leather.

## Seal Types

Understanding seal categories helps match the right seal to the application.

### Static Seals (Gaskets)

**Definition:** Seals between non-moving parts.

**Types:**
- Flat gaskets (between flanges)
- O-rings (in grooves)
- Formed-in-place gaskets (sealants)

**Materials:**
- Paper, fiber (low pressure)
- Cork (medium pressure)
- Rubber (all pressures, requires groove)
- Leather (low to medium pressure)
- Metal (high pressure, high temperature)

**Function:** Fill imperfections in mating surfaces, create seal under clamping force.

**Installation:**
- Clean surfaces (remove old gasket material)
- Install new gasket
- Tighten fasteners evenly (prevents distortion)
- Don't overtighten (crushes gasket)

**Failure Mode:** Leaks develop from:
- Insufficient clamping force
- Over-compression (gasket crushed)
- Surface damage (scratches, corrosion)
- Aging (gasket hardens, cracks)

### Dynamic Seals (Rotating/Reciprocating)

**Definition:** Seals on moving parts.

**Challenge:** Must seal while allowing motion. Friction, wear, and heat are issues.

**Types:**

#### Lip Seals
- Flexible lip contacts shaft
- Light spring provides pressure
- Wipes one direction (oil in, dirt out)
- **Material:** Rubber (vulcanized)
- **Application:** Shaft exits from housing (gearboxes, engines)

**Installation:**
- Press into housing
- Lip faces oil side
- Don't damage lip on shaft (chamfer edge)

#### Packing (Glands)
- Compressible material around shaft
- Adjusted for proper sealing
- **Material:** Rope, hemp, graphite-impregnated fiber
- **Application:** Valve stems, pump shafts, piston rods

**Adjustment:**
- Tighten until leakage is small weep
- Over-tightening causes friction, heat, failure

#### Mechanical Seals (Advanced)
- Precision flat faces press together
- One face rotates, one stationary
- Requires machining precision
- **Application:** Pumps (high pressure, zero leakage required)

**Reality:** Mechanical seals are beyond early post-collapse capability. Use packing or lip seals instead.

### O-Rings

**Description:** Round cross-section rubber ring, sits in groove, compresses to seal.

**Advantages:**
- Simple design
- Reliable seal
- Static or dynamic (slow motion only)
- Compact

**Disadvantages:**
- Requires rubber (vulcanized)
- Groove must be precise (wrong size = failure)

**Salvage and Reuse:**
- Collect O-rings from all sources (engines, hydraulics, appliances)
- Store by size (sort and catalog)
- Protect from ozone, sunlight, heat (degrades rubber)
- Consider O-rings non-renewable for decades post-collapse

**Making O-Rings Post-Collapse:**
Difficult. Requires:
1. Vulcanized rubber sheet
2. Precision cutting (tube, then slice rings)
3. Joining ends (vulcanize splice)

**Quality:** Homemade O-rings are inferior to molded originals. Use salvaged O-rings for critical applications, homemade for less demanding uses.

## Bearing Design for Available Lubricants

The lubricant you have determines the bearing design you can use. High-performance bearings need high-performance lubricants.

### Plain Bearings (Bushings)

**Description:** Simplest bearing type. Shaft rotates inside cylindrical hole.

**Advantages:**
- Easy to make
- Tolerant of dirt and contamination
- Works with crude lubricants
- Handles shock loads well

**Materials:**

#### Bronze (Copper-Tin Alloy)
- **Composition:** 90% copper, 10% tin
- **Properties:** Self-lubricating (porous types absorb oil), wear-resistant
- **Application:** General-purpose, low to medium speed

#### Babbitt (Tin-Lead Alloy)
- **Composition:** Various (common: 80% tin, 15% antimony, 5% copper)
- **Properties:** Soft, embeds dirt particles, doesn't damage shaft
- **Application:** Engine bearings, high-load

#### Cast Iron
- **Properties:** Cheap, adequate for low speed
- **Application:** Low-load, low-speed (hand-powered tools)

#### Wood (Lignum Vitae)
- **Properties:** Self-lubricating (contains natural oils), works in water
- **Application:** Water-lubricated bearings (ship propeller shafts, water pumps)

**Design Considerations:**

**Clearance:** Space between shaft and bearing is critical.
- **Too tight:** High friction, heat, seizure
- **Too loose:** Excessive wear, noise, vibration
- **Rule of thumb:** 0.001-0.003 inches clearance per inch of shaft diameter

Example: 2-inch shaft → 0.002-0.006 inches clearance (diameter)

**Oil Grooves:** Channels cut into bearing surface distribute oil.
- Spiral groove: Pumps oil along shaft
- Axial groove: Distributes oil circumferentially
- Oil hole: Entry point for lubrication

**Length-to-Diameter Ratio:** Longer bearings support more load but generate more friction.
- Short bearing (L/D = 0.5): High speed, light load
- Long bearing (L/D = 2.0): Low speed, heavy load
- General purpose: L/D = 1.0 to 1.5

**Lubrication:** Plain bearings need continuous oil film. Use:
- Heavy oil for low speed
- Light oil for high speed
- Grease if rotational speed allows (low speed only)

### Rolling Element Bearings

**Description:** Balls or rollers between races. Rolling contact instead of sliding.

**Advantages:**
- Low friction (1/10 to 1/50 of plain bearings)
- Precise operation
- High speed capability

**Disadvantages:**
- Difficult to manufacture (precision grinding required)
- Sensitive to contamination
- Expensive (post-collapse)

**Types:**

#### Ball Bearings
- Spherical balls
- Point contact (low load capacity)
- High speed
- Require precise spheres (difficult to make)

#### Roller Bearings
- Cylindrical rollers
- Line contact (higher load capacity)
- Lower speed than balls
- Easier to make (still difficult)

#### Needle Bearings
- Very small diameter rollers
- Compact design
- High load capacity for size
- **Easier to make than balls** (turn thin rods)

**Making Rolling Element Bearings:**

This is advanced work, requiring precision machinery (lathe, grinder).

**Needle Bearing (Most Achievable):**
1. Turn hardened steel rods to precise diameter (1/8" typical)
2. Cut to length
3. Harden (heat treat) if not already hard
4. Polish (reduce friction)
5. Install in races with minimal clearance

**Quality:** Homemade rolling element bearings are inferior. Salvage modern bearings whenever possible.

**Lubrication:** Rolling element bearings use grease (medium consistency) or light oil. Keep them clean - contamination destroys them.

### Wood Bearings (Lignum Vitae)

**Special Mention:** This wood is remarkable.

**Properties:**
- Extremely dense (sinks in water)
- Contains natural guaiacol oil (10-20%)
- Self-lubricating
- Wear-resistant
- Works in water or oil

**Source:** Tropical tree (Guaiacum officinale, Guaiacum sanctum), very slow-growing, now rare.

**Historical Use:**
- Ship propeller shaft bearings (water-lubricated)
- Water pump bearings
- Clock bearings

**Modern Availability:** Limited. If you find lignum vitae, save it for special applications.

**Alternatives:** Other dense hardwoods (maple, hornbeam, boxwood) work for low-speed water-lubricated bearings, but aren't as good.

**Application:** Low speed, high load, wet environments. Water pumps are the primary post-collapse use.

## Maintenance Practices

Lubrication isn't set-and-forget. Regular maintenance is the difference between decades of service and rapid failure.

### Lubrication Schedules

**Create a maintenance log:**
- List every bearing, gear, seal in your machinery
- Assign lubrication interval (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, annual)
- Record each lubrication event
- Note any issues (leaks, heat, noise)

**Typical Intervals:**

- **Daily:** High-speed or critical machinery (engines, mills in constant use)
- **Weekly:** Moderate-use machinery (workshop tools)
- **Monthly:** Low-use machinery, open gears, chains
- **Quarterly:** Sealed bearings (grease repacking)
- **Annually:** Complete overhaul, seal replacement

**Reality:** You'll be tempted to skip maintenance when machinery is running well. Don't. The bearing that feels fine today seizes tomorrow if you miss its lubrication.

### Oil Changes

Oil degrades over time and use. Contamination and oxidation destroy its lubricating properties.

**Why Change Oil:**
- Contamination (metal particles, dust, water)
- Oxidation (reacts with oxygen, becomes acidic)
- Additive depletion (anti-wear compounds get used up)
- Thermal breakdown (heat breaks molecular chains)

**Signs Oil Needs Changing:**
- Dark color (carbon, metal particles)
- Milky appearance (water contamination)
- Sludge formation (oxidation products)
- Burnt smell (overheating)
- Increased viscosity (thickening)

**Intervals:**
- **Engines:** 50-100 hours (petroleum oil), 10-20 hours (vegetable oil)
- **Gearboxes:** 500-1000 hours or annually
- **Hydraulics:** 1000 hours or when contaminated
- **Bearings:** When contaminated or annually

**Disposal:** Dirty oil is still useful:
- Burn as fuel (low quality)
- Rust prevention (coat idle tools)
- Wood preservation (fence posts, beams)
- Don't dump it (environmental damage, waste of resource)

### Grease Repacking

Grease doesn't last forever in bearings. It oxidizes, contaminates, and loses effectiveness.

**Procedure:**
1. Disassemble bearing housing
2. Remove old grease (wipe clean)
3. Inspect bearing (wear, damage, corrosion)
4. Pack with fresh grease (fill voids, not excessive)
5. Reassemble
6. Run briefly (purges excess)

**Frequency:**
- **High-use bearings:** Quarterly
- **Moderate-use:** Annually
- **Low-use:** Every 2-3 years

**Over-Greasing:** Worse than under-greasing. Excess grease causes churning, heat, and seal failure. Fill bearing 30-50%, not 100%.

### Seal Inspection and Replacement

Seals wear out. Inspect them before they fail catastrophically.

**Inspection Points:**
- **Leakage:** Any oil seepage is a warning sign
- **Wear:** Visible damage to seal lip or surface
- **Hardening:** Seal becomes stiff (aged rubber)
- **Cracking:** Visible cracks (aged leather or rubber)
- **Shaft wear:** Groove worn in shaft at seal contact

**Replacement Indicators:**
- Visible leakage
- Seal is hard or cracked
- Seal has been in service 5+ years (rubber)
- Seal has been in service 10+ years (leather)

**Preventive Replacement:** Don't wait for failure. Replace seals on schedule (5 years for rubber, 10 years for leather) even if they look okay. A $1 seal protects $1000 of machinery.

### Filtration

Clean oil lasts longer. Filtering extends oil life significantly.

**Simple Filtration:**
- Pour oil through cloth (removes particles)
- Settle oil (let stand, particles sink, decant clean oil)
- Centrifuge (spin rapidly, particles separate) - advanced

**Effect:** Can double or triple oil life. A simple cloth filter is worth the effort.

**Frequency:** Filter oil during every change. Filter in-service oil if contamination is visible.

## Lubrication Systems

How lubricant reaches bearing surfaces matters. Simple systems are more reliable but require more manual intervention.

### Splash Lubrication

**Method:** Moving parts dip into oil bath, splash oil onto surfaces.

**Mechanism:**
- Sump (reservoir) at bottom of housing
- Crankshaft, gears, or dippers contact oil
- Rotation flings oil upward
- Oil drains back to sump

**Applications:**
- Engine crankcases (small engines)
- Gearboxes
- Enclosed machinery

**Advantages:**
- Simple (no pump)
- Reliable
- Self-regulating (more speed = more splash)

**Disadvantages:**
- Requires oil level maintenance
- Inefficient at very low speeds (insufficient splash)
- Aeration (oil foams if splashed excessively)

**Design:**
- Oil level must reach dipping components
- Sight glass or dipstick for level checking
- Drain plug for oil changes

### Drip Oilers

**Method:** Gravity-fed oil drips onto bearing at controlled rate.

**Construction:**
- Reservoir (can, bottle)
- Adjustable valve (needle valve or wick)
- Sight glass (counts drops)
- Feed tube to bearing

**Adjustment:** Set drip rate by observing drops per minute (typically 1-10 drops/minute depending on bearing size and speed).

**Applications:**
- Machine tool bearings
- Shaft bearings
- Anywhere constant, slow oil feed is needed

**Advantages:**
- Continuous lubrication
- Visual confirmation (see drips)
- No power required
- Adjustable

**Disadvantages:**
- Requires monitoring and refilling
- Can run dry (catastrophic if unnoticed)
- Ambient temperature affects flow rate

**Maintenance:**
- Check oil level daily
- Clean needle valve if clogged
- Adjust drip rate seasonally (cold oil flows slower)

### Wick Feeders

**Method:** Capillary action draws oil through wick to bearing.

**Construction:**
- Oil reservoir
- Wool, felt, or cotton wick
- Wick contacts oil and bearing

**Mechanism:** Oil climbs wick by capillary action, continuously feeds bearing at slow rate.

**Applications:**
- Clock mechanisms
- Light machinery
- Slow-moving bearings

**Advantages:**
- Simple (no valves)
- Continuous feed
- Self-regulating (faster shaft draws more oil from wick)

**Disadvantages:**
- Limited oil flow (low-speed only)
- Wick degrades over time
- Wick can dry out if reservoir empties

**Maintenance:**
- Replace wick annually
- Keep reservoir filled
- Ensure wick maintains contact with oil and bearing

### Grease Cups

**Method:** Hand-operated cup forces grease into bearing.

**Construction:**
- Threaded cup (reservoir) filled with grease
- Screw cap compresses grease
- Passage feeds grease to bearing

**Operation:**
- Turn cap 1-2 turns (daily, weekly, or monthly depending on application)
- Grease forced into bearing
- Refill cup when empty (quarterly to annually)

**Applications:**
- Plain bearings (shafts, journals)
- Slides
- Any point needing periodic grease

**Advantages:**
- Simple
- No power required
- Positive feeding (grease doesn't drip away)
- Visual indicator (cup empties, you know bearing was greased)

**Disadvantages:**
- Requires manual operation (someone must turn the cap)
- Can over-grease if operated too frequently
- Cold grease doesn't flow (warm weather works better)

**Maintenance:**
- Operate on schedule (don't forget)
- Refill cup when empty
- Clean threads if they bind

### Pressure Lubrication (Pump-Fed)

**Method:** Pump forces oil to bearings under pressure.

**Construction:**
- Oil pump (gear pump typical)
- Oil galleries (drilled passages)
- Pressure gauge
- Relief valve (prevents over-pressure)
- Oil filter

**Applications:**
- Engines (all modern engines)
- High-speed machinery
- Critical applications requiring guaranteed lubrication

**Advantages:**
- Positive lubrication (bearing gets oil even if passages partially blocked)
- Large volume (can cool as well as lubricate)
- Filtration (oil passes through filter)
- Monitoring (pressure gauge confirms operation)

**Disadvantages:**
- Complex
- Requires power (pump driven by engine or motor)
- Failure risk (pump fails = no lubrication = rapid engine destruction)

**Design:**
- Pump capacity must supply all bearings
- Galleries must reach every bearing
- Pressure: 30-60 PSI typical
- Relief valve: Opens at 60-80 PSI (prevents seal damage)

**Maintenance:**
- Monitor pressure gauge (low pressure = problem)
- Change oil filter regularly
- Inspect pump for wear

**Reality:** Pressure lubrication is advanced. Early post-collapse machinery will use simpler systems (splash, drip, grease cups). Only invest in pressure systems for critical machinery where reliability justifies the complexity.

## Common Failures and Solutions

Understanding failure modes helps prevent them.

### Seizure

**Symptom:** Machine suddenly locks up, won't rotate.

**Cause:** Inadequate lubricant film. Metal-to-metal contact generates heat, surfaces weld together.

**Contributing Factors:**
- No lubrication (empty reservoir, clogged oiler)
- Wrong lubricant (too thin for load)
- Overload (exceeds bearing capacity)
- Overheating (lubricant breaks down)

**Prevention:**
- Maintain lubrication schedule
- Use correct lubricant for application
- Don't overload machinery
- Monitor temperature (hot bearing = problem)

**Recovery:**
- **Caught early:** Stop immediately, cool down, lubricate, may recover
- **Full seizure:** Disassemble, inspect damage, replace bearing/shaft if welded

**Reality:** Seizure is often catastrophic. Prevention is the only cure.

### Rapid Wear

**Symptom:** Bearing or gear wears out much faster than expected.

**Cause:** Multiple possible:

1. **Wrong lubricant viscosity:**
   - Too thin: Film breaks down under load
   - Too thick: Doesn't flow, starves bearing

2. **Contamination:**
   - Abrasive particles (dust, metal) in oil
   - Acts like grinding compound

3. **Misalignment:**
   - Uneven load distribution
   - Edges wear faster than center

4. **Overload:**
   - Exceeds bearing design capacity
   - Accelerated wear

**Solution:**
- Use correct viscosity for application
- Filter oil, keep clean
- Align shafts and bearings properly
- Reduce load or upgrade bearing

**Prevention:**
- Regular oil changes
- Seal against contamination
- Proper installation (alignment)
- Don't exceed design limits

### Leaks

**Symptom:** Oil dripping, puddles under machinery.

**Cause:**
- Seal failure (worn, damaged, aged)
- Gasket failure (crushed, hardened)
- Over-filling (oil level too high)
- Pressure buildup (blocked vent)

**Solution:**
- Replace seal/gasket
- Correct oil level
- Ensure housing has vent (prevents pressure)

**Prevention:**
- Replace seals on schedule (before they fail)
- Don't over-fill
- Vent enclosed housings

**Impact:** Leaks waste precious lubricant and allow contamination entry. Fix them promptly.

### Contamination

**Symptom:** Oil appears dirty, gritty, or milky.

**Cause:**
- Dirt entry (inadequate sealing)
- Water entry (condensation, leaking seal)
- Metal particles (wear products)

**Solution:**
- Replace oil
- Improve sealing
- Filter oil
- Fix source of contamination

**Prevention:**
- Proper seals and gaskets
- Drain condensation (water traps at low points)
- Filtration systems

**Impact:** Contaminated oil destroys bearings rapidly. Clean oil is critical.

### Overheating

**Symptom:** Bearing, gearbox, or engine runs hot (too hot to touch).

**Cause:**
- Insufficient lubrication (inadequate oil flow)
- Wrong viscosity (too thick, churning generates heat)
- Overload (excessive power demand)
- Friction (misalignment, damage)

**Solution:**
- Increase lubrication (flow rate or frequency)
- Use correct viscosity oil
- Reduce load or speed
- Align and repair

**Prevention:**
- Correct lubrication from start
- Don't overload machinery
- Monitor temperature (hand-check bearings during operation)

**Impact:** Heat destroys lubricant, accelerates wear, leads to seizure. Hot bearings are a warning sign - address immediately.

## Timeline and Technology Progression

Lubrication capabilities evolve as you rebuild industrial capacity.

   - If too thin: Continue cooking
   - If too thick: Add small amount of base oil

6. **Pour and Cool:**
   - Transfer to storage container while warm
   - Stir occasionally while cooling (prevents separation)
   - Seal when cool

**Success Criteria:**
- Consistency: Soft paste (spreads easily but doesn't run)
- Appearance: Smooth, uniform (no lumps or separation)
- Color: Opaque, creamy (varies with ingredients)

**Application:**
- Use in wheel bearings, slides, slow-moving machinery
- Apply with brush or pack into bearing by hand

**Storage:** Sealed container, cool location. Use within 6 months for best results.

### Project 2: Make a Felt Seal

**Difficulty:** Easy

**Materials:**
- Wool felt (3-5mm thick)
- Light oil (for soaking)
- Shaft (to fit seal to)

**Tools:**
- Sharp knife or scissors
- Punch (for center hole) - optional
- Compass or circle template

**Procedure:**

1. **Measure Shaft:**
   - Diameter of shaft
   - Diameter of housing (if seal fits in housing)
   - Add clearance (seal should be snug, not tight)

2. **Cut Felt:**
   - **Outer diameter:** Housing diameter minus 1-2mm (compression fit)
   - **Inner diameter:** Shaft diameter plus 0.5-1mm (light drag)
   - Cut circle with knife/scissors
   - Punch center hole (or cut carefully)

3. **Soak in Oil:**
   - Immerse felt in light oil
   - Allow to saturate (15-30 minutes)
   - Remove, squeeze gently (remove excess)

4. **Install:**
   - Slide onto shaft (stretch inner hole if needed)
   - Press into housing
   - Should sit with light contact on shaft

**Success Criteria:**
- Fits snugly in housing (doesn't fall out)
- Contacts shaft lightly (wipes but doesn't drag heavily)
- Oil-saturated (dark, pliable)

**Application:**
- Wiper seal (keeps dirt out of bearing)
- Light oil retention seal
- Dust excluder

**Lifespan:** Replace annually or when felt becomes hard or torn.

### Project 3: Make a Leather Cup Seal

**Difficulty:** Moderate

**Materials:**
- Thick leather (3-5mm, vegetable-tanned)
- Light oil or grease
- Backing ring (metal washer or disk)

**Tools:**
- Sharp knife
- Punch (for center hole)
- Form (cylinder to shape cup)
- Oil for treating leather

**Procedure:**

1. **Cut Leather Disk:**
   - Diameter: 2× piston/plunger diameter
   - Cut circle with knife
   - Punch center hole (shaft diameter)

2. **Form Cup:**
   - Soak leather in warm water (softens)
   - Place over form (round cylinder)
   - Press edges down to create cup shape
   - Allow to dry while formed (retains shape)

3. **Trim:**
   - Trim outer diameter to desired size
   - Cup edge should flare outward (sealing direction)

4. **Oil Treatment:**
   - Soak in light oil or grease
   - Work oil into leather thoroughly
   - Wipe excess

5. **Assemble:**
   - Place backing ring behind leather (supports cup)
   - Install on plunger (cup opens toward pressure side)
   - Secure with retaining nut or press fit

**Success Criteria:**
- Cup shape maintained (doesn't flatten)
- Edges flare outward (seal when pressure applied)
- Flexible, not stiff
- Oil-saturated

**Application:**
- Pump plungers (water, oil)
- Hydraulic cylinders
- Air compressor pistons (low pressure)

**Maintenance:**
- Keep oiled (prevents drying and cracking)
- Replace when stiff or cracked (annually to every few years)

**Direction:** Cup MUST open toward pressure side. Pressure forces cup edges outward, creating seal. Installed backward = no seal.

### Project 4: Build a Drip Oiler

**Difficulty:** Moderate

**Materials:**
- Reservoir (bottle, can, small tank)
- Needle valve OR adjustable clamp
- Clear tube (sight glass for viewing drops)
- Feed tube (to bearing)
- Mounting bracket

**Tools:**
- Drill
- Thread tap (if using threaded valve)
- Saw (cutting tubes)
- Sealant (for connections)

**Procedure:**

1. **Prepare Reservoir:**
   - Clean container thoroughly
   - Drill hole in bottom for valve/tube
   - Drill hole in top for vent (prevents vacuum)
   - Install fill cap (removable for refilling)

2. **Install Valve:**
   - **Option A:** Thread needle valve into bottom hole
   - **Option B:** Install tube through hole, use adjustable clamp on outside
   - Seal connection (prevents leaks)

3. **Sight Glass:**
   - Attach clear tube below valve (vertical segment)
   - 4-6 inches long (enough to count drops)
   - Secure to mounting bracket

4. **Feed Tube:**
   - Attach tube from sight glass to bearing
   - Route to drip directly onto bearing surface
   - Secure tubing (prevent movement)

5. **Mount:**
   - Attach reservoir above bearing (gravity feed)
   - Ensure stable (won't tip or fall)
   - Position sight glass for easy viewing

6. **Adjust:**
   - Fill reservoir with oil
   - Open valve slightly
   - Observe drops in sight glass
   - Adjust to desired rate (typically 1-10 drops/minute)

**Success Criteria:**
- Steady drip rate (not gushing or stopped)
- No leaks
- Sight glass visible (can count drops)
- Drips land on bearing

**Adjustment:**
- Monitor bearing temperature (insufficient oil = heat)
- Increase drip rate if bearing runs warm
- Decrease if oil pools or wastes

**Maintenance:**
- Refill oil reservoir (check daily initially, then as needed)
- Clean valve if clogged (disassemble, flush)
- Adjust for temperature (cold oil flows slower)

**Application:** Any shaft bearing needing continuous lubrication. Especially useful for machinery running many hours daily.

## Conclusion: The Unsexy Necessity

If you've read this far, congratulations. You've just absorbed one of the most critical and least glamorous chapters in this entire book.

You won't get glory for maintaining lubrication. Nobody writes songs about the technician who religiously changes oil. There are no monuments to the engineer who designed a good grease cup.

But that technician and that engineer keep civilization running.

The windmill that grinds grain for a village? It runs on lubrication. The lathe that makes precision parts? It depends on clean oil. The engine that powers a sawmill? It lives or dies based on maintenance schedules.

**The brutal reality:** In the first decade after collapse, you will see dozens of excellent machines destroyed by lubrication failure. Beautiful restoration work, clever mechanical design, careful material selection - all wasted because someone didn't pack a bearing or thought animal fat would work in a high-speed application.

Don't be that person.

**Prioritize lubrication:**
- Hoard petroleum oil like gold (it's more valuable)
- Learn to make grease (calcium grease is achievable)
- Salvage every seal, gasket, and O-ring
- Create maintenance schedules and follow them religiously
- Train others (one person knowing this isn't enough)

**Remember:** The most brilliant machine in the world is worthless if its bearings seize after three days.

The dullest, simplest machine that runs reliably for decades because someone maintained its lubrication is infinitely more valuable.

Be the person who understands this. Be the person who makes lubrication a priority. Be the person who keeps the machines running.

That's not glamorous. It's essential.

And in the post-collapse world, essential beats glamorous every single time.
