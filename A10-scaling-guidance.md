# Appendix A10: Scaling Guidance

*How to scale production from individual crafting to industrial levels, including minimum viable community sizes for each technology.*

---

## Understanding Scale

Technology production exists at different scales, each with different requirements:

| Scale | Output | Labor | Organization | Example |
|-------|--------|-------|--------------|---------|
| Individual | One-off items | 1 person | Self | Blacksmith making a knife |
| Craft | Small batches | 1-3 people | Master + apprentices | Forge making tools to order |
| Workshop | Regular production | 5-20 people | Specialization begins | Foundry serving a village |
| Manufactory | Continuous production | 20-100 people | Division of labor | Iron works for a region |
| Factory | Industrial output | 100+ people | Full specialization | Steel mill serving multiple cities |

This appendix addresses how to transition between scales and what resources each level requires.

## Part 1: Minimum Viable Community Sizes

### The 50-Person Threshold

Below 50 people, you cannot maintain specialized full-time roles. Everyone must be a generalist. Technology production is limited to:
- Basic blacksmithing (part-time smith)
- Simple textiles (everyone spins, some weave)
- Salvage and repair
- Agriculture and food processing

### The 150-Person Threshold

At 150 people, you can support several full-time specialists:
- 1-2 blacksmiths/metalworkers
- 1-2 weavers/textile workers
- 1 medical practitioner
- Construction/maintenance workers

Technology production expands to:
- Regular tool production
- Basic electrical work (generators, wiring)
- Simple chemistry (soap, preservatives)
- Basic medical care

### The 500-Person Threshold

At 500 people, workshops become viable:
- Dedicated forge/foundry facility
- Textile production facility
- Glassmaking possible
- Telegraph network practical
- Medical clinic with multiple staff

### The 2,000-Person Threshold

At 2,000 people, manufactories become viable:
- Iron/steel production at scale
- Power generation station
- Radio station
- Hospital
- Multiple specialized workshops

### The 10,000-Person Threshold

At 10,000 people, industrial production becomes possible:
- Factory-scale metalworking
- Machine tool production
- Chemical industry
- Electronics manufacturing
- Educational institutions

## Part 2: Scaling Metallurgy

### Bloomery to Blast Furnace

#### Bloomery Scale (1-3 people)
- Output: 2-10 kg iron per smelt
- Batch process: hours per run
- Fuel: charcoal
- Ore flexibility: wide variety works
- Quality: variable, requires forging to consolidate

**When to stay at this scale**:
- Population under 200
- Iron needs under 50 kg/year
- No reliable ore source
- Insufficient charcoal production

#### Small Blast Furnace (5-10 people)
- Output: 50-200 kg iron per day
- Continuous operation (once started)
- Fuel: charcoal or coke
- Requires better ore preparation
- Produces cast iron (must be refined for wrought iron/steel)

**Prerequisites for transition**:
- Reliable ore supply (tons per week)
- Charcoal production infrastructure
- Skilled workers for 24/7 operation
- Downstream capacity (finery, forge)
- Market for output

**Transition steps**:
1. Build larger charcoal production first
2. Stockpile ore
3. Train workers on continuous operation
4. Build finery for refining cast iron
5. Start furnace and maintain until established

### Hand Forging to Machine Shop

#### Hand Forging (1-2 people)
- Output: items per day
- Skill-dependent quality
- Limited precision
- Wide product range possible

#### Mechanized Forge (5-10 people)

- Drill press
- Possibly milling machine
- Precision work possible
- Makes tools for other industries

**Prerequisites for machine shop**:
- Reliable power source
- Precision measurement capability
- Steel of consistent quality
- Trained machinists (long apprenticeship)
- Demand for precision parts

**Transition steps**:
1. Acquire or build first lathe
2. Train operators

## Part 8: Economic Scaling Thresholds

### When to Scale Up

Scale up when:
- Current capacity limits growth
- Consistent demand exceeds supply
- Quality improvement requires better equipment
- Labor efficiency gains justify investment
- Prerequisite technologies are available

Do NOT scale up when:
- Demand is uncertain
- Prerequisites not met
- Cannot staff the larger operation
- Quality acceptable at current scale
- Resources better used elsewhere

### Investment Payback

Calculate whether scaling makes sense:

```
Annual savings = (Current cost - New cost) × Annual volume
Payback period = Investment cost ÷ Annual savings
```

**Rule of thumb**: Payback should be under 3 years for most investments in rebuilding scenario (uncertainty is high).

### Example: Scaling Iron Production

Current: Bloomery producing 500 kg/year at 100 labor-hours/100kg
Proposed: Small blast furnace producing 5,000 kg/year at 20 labor-hours/100kg

```
Current labor: 500 hours/year
New labor: 1,000 hours/year (but 10× output)
Labor per unit: 100 → 20 hours/100kg
Savings: 80 hours/100kg

If labor value = 1 kg grain/hour
Annual savings = (80 hours × 50 units) × 1 = 4,000 kg grain equivalent
Investment: 2,000 labor hours = 2,000 kg grain equivalent
Payback: 6 months
```

This investment makes sense if:
- Market exists for 10× iron output
- Can staff continuous operation
- Ore and charcoal supply available

---

## Part 9: Organizational Scaling

### Span of Control

**Practical limits**:
- One supervisor can effectively manage 5-10 direct reports
- Larger operations need hierarchy
- Each level adds coordination overhead

### Specialization Thresholds

| Operation Size | Organization |
|----------------|--------------|
| 1-3 | One person does everything |
| 4-10 | 2-3 specialties, one lead |
| 11-20 | 4-6 specialties, 2 leads, 1 coordinator |
| 21-50 | Full departments, management layer |
| 50+ | Formal hierarchy required |

### Communication Needs

Number of relationships = n(n-1)/2

| People | Relationships | Communication Challenge |
|--------|---------------|------------------------|
| 5 | 10 | Manageable |
| 10 | 45 | Needs structure |
| 20 | 190 | Requires formal channels |
| 50 | 1,225 | Impossible without hierarchy |

**Solution**: Create subgroups with representatives communicating between groups.

---

## Part 10: Scaling Decision Framework

### Questions to Answer

1. **Is there demand for increased output?**
   - Current customers
   - Potential new applications
   - Export/trade possibilities

2. **Are prerequisites met?**
   - Raw material supply
   - Power availability
   - Supporting technologies
   - Trained workers

3. **Can you staff the larger operation?**
   - Number of workers needed
   - Skills required
   - Training time
   - Organizational structure

4. **Is the investment justified?**
   - Payback period
   - Opportunity cost
   - Risk tolerance

5. **What's the fallback plan?**
   - Keep smaller operation running during transition
   - Plan for scaling back if needed
   - Maintain core capabilities

### Red Flags

**Don't scale if**:
- Demand is from one customer who might disappear
- Key person dependency (what if expert leaves?)
- Raw material supply uncertain
- No clear path to staffing
- Prerequisite technology unreliable
- "Someone else will want this" (speculative demand)

### Green Lights

**Scale when**:
- Multiple independent demand sources
- Trained backup personnel exist
- Supply chain established
- Payback under 2 years
- Prerequisites proven reliable
- Current capacity demonstrably limiting

## Conclusion

Scaling is not automatic or always desirable. Each transition requires:
- Clear demand justification
- Prerequisite technologies in place
- Sufficient trained personnel
- Organizational capability
- Investment resources

The goal is not maximum scale but appropriate scale for your community's needs and capabilities. A well-run bloomery may serve a small community better than a struggling blast furnace.

Start small, prove the technology works, build demand, develop expertise, then scale deliberately.
